//! Pure Rust port of Clipper 1, i.e. polyclipping 6.4.2 by Angus Johnson
//! (libs/polyclipping/clipper.{hpp,cpp} in the LibrePCB repository, Boost
//! Software License 1.0, see `License.txt`).
//!
//! Clipper performs boolean operations (intersection, union, difference,
//! xor) on polygons with integer coordinates, and offsets polygons and
//! polylines.
//!
//! # Why a port
//!
//! LibrePCB computes board planes, copper/stop mask/solder paste areas and
//! the geometry of exported production data (Gerber, ...) with Clipper 1.
//! These outputs must be identical to upstream LibrePCB, i.e. the same
//! vertices in the same order, the same polygon order and the same polygon
//! tree. No existing crate reproduces Clipper 1 (there is no pure Rust
//! Clipper 1 port on crates.io). Pure Rust alternatives were evaluated
//! against the C++ library on 1012 cases built from the geometry in
//! LibrePCB's test data (union/intersection/difference with Paths and
//! PolyTree output, round offsets with arc tolerance 5000 nm):
//!
//! | crate                        | exact | same rings¹ | same area | area ±0.1% |
//! |------------------------------|------:|------------:|----------:|-----------:|
//! | `clipper2-rust` 1.2.0        | 44.8% |       52.6% |     62.3% |      99.8% |
//! | `i_overlay` 9.0.0 (i64)      |  5.2% |       51.9% |     59.1% |      85.8% |
//! | `geo` 0.33.1 (via i_overlay) |  5.1% |       47.9% |     49.0% |      73.8% |
//! | `knipsa` 0.3.0               |  4.6% |       44.2% |     49.0% |      80.5% |
//!
//! ¹ Ignoring ring order, start vertex and orientation.
//!
//! Typical divergences: extra collinear vertices kept (Clipper2, knipsa),
//! polygons touching in a vertex merged instead of split (or vice versa),
//! different start vertex/ring order/tree nesting (i_overlay, geo),
//! different number of arc vertices in round offsets (all; no candidate
//! matched a single negative offset), and overlapping inputs of negative
//! offsets merged differently. Hence this crate is a faithful, line-by-line
//! port:
//!
//! - Same algorithm, same floating point expressions (evaluated in the same
//!   order), same rounding (including the behavior of the C++ double to
//!   integer conversion on x86-64 for out-of-range values), same 128 bit
//!   integer math and coordinate range checks. Transcendental functions
//!   (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `acos`, `atan2`) come from the [`libm`] crate,
//!   so results do not depend on the platform's C library; they differ from
//!   glibc in the last bit for some inputs, which did not change any golden
//!   vector (captured with glibc) after rounding to integer coordinates.
//! - The linked data structures (edges, output points, output records, joins,
//!   poly nodes) live in arenas and reference each other by index instead of
//!   raw pointers. No `unsafe` code.
//! - `std::sort()` is replaced by an exact replica of the libstdc++
//!   implementation (see [`std_sort`]), because the (unstable) order of equal
//!   elements affects the output.
//! - Exceptions are replaced by [`Error`]; `Execute()` returning `false` is
//!   mapped to [`Error::ExecutionFailed`] (except for the "nothing to do"
//!   case, which returns an empty solution).
//!
//! The port was verified with a differential test against the original C++
//! library (random and real-world inputs, all operations and fill types);
//! `tests/golden.rs` replays a subset of these cases.
//!
//! Configuration of the original: 64 bit coordinates (no `use_int32`), no Z
//! coordinate (no `use_xyz`), line clipping enabled (`use_lines`).
