//! Errors of the editor crate.

//! Model level errors are the [`project::Error`]s of the mutations (with
//! the upstream messages); the variants below are the errors the upstream
//! editor commands and states throw themselves (translated with their
//! upstream Qt context) plus argument errors of the command parameters,
//! which have no upstream counterpart (upstream gets them from the UI).
