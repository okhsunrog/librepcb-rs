//! Render backends.
//!
//! A backend turns a [`Scene`] seen through a [`View`] into pixels. It keeps
//! its own encoding of every render group (keyed by [`GroupId`], re-encoded
//! when [`GroupView::rev`] changes) and uses [`Scene::damage_since`] and
//! [`Scene::selection_rev`] to repaint only what changed.
//!
//! [`CpuRenderer`] (vello_cpu) is the only backend so far. A GPU backend
//! (vello on Slint's wgpu device) will implement the same trait, plus a
//! texture-based path in the Slint adapter.
//!
//! [`GroupId`]: crate::GroupId
//! [`GroupView::rev`]: crate::GroupView::rev
