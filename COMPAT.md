# Intentional divergences from upstream LibrePCB

Behavior differences of the Rust port compared to the C++ reference
(`../LibrePCB`), including exotic edge cases, usually because upstream relies
on Qt semantics that are not reproduced. File formats are unaffected unless
stated otherwise. Entries are grouped by module.

## General

- **Whitespace**: `char::is_whitespace()` / `str::trim()` /
  `str::split_whitespace()` replace `QChar::isSpace()` /
  `QString::trimmed()` / `QString::simplified()`. Both use the same set
  (Unicode White_Space = categories Zs, Zl, Zp plus `\t`..`\r` and U+0085),
  so results are identical apart from Unicode version differences.
- **String ordering** is `str` ordering (code points) instead of `QString`
  ordering (UTF-16 code units). The two only differ when comparing
  characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane with U+E000..U+FFFF.
  Affected: `SExpression`'s `Ord` impl, `PcbColor::all()` (sorted by
  translated name), and the file lists noted under fileio below.
- **Transcendental functions** (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `acos`, `atan`,
  `atan2`, `hypot`, the math parser functions) come from the `libm` crate in
  `librepcb-core` and `clipper`, so results are identical on all platforms.
  Upstream calls the platform C library (glibc, MSVC CRT, ...) except for
  the functions it routes through its own Rust code (`Point::rotated()`,
  arc radius/center), which already use `libm`. `libm` differs from glibc
  in the last bit for some inputs (1–18% of random inputs, depending on the
  function); none of the test vectors captured with glibc/upstream (Clipper
  golden vectors incl. round and square offsets, upstream arc flattening
  and geometry tests, round-trip files) changed after rounding to integer
  coordinates. A different result
  would require an intermediate value within one ulp of a rounding
  boundary. `sqrt` and basic arithmetic stay native (correctly rounded
  everywhere). Exception: `^` in the math parser is evaluated by `evalexpr`
  with `f64::powf()` (platform library).

## types

- **`ElementName` / `SimpleString` validity** is expressed natively: at most
  70 characters (`ElementName` only), BMP characters only, no characters of
  general category Control, Format, Surrogate, Private Use or Unassigned.
  This is exactly the set upstream accepts (`QString::length() <= 70` and
  `QChar::isPrint()` per UTF-16 code unit, which rejects surrogates).
- **Decimal numbers in files** (`Length`, `Angle`, `Ratio`, ... via
  `decimal_fixed_point_from_string()`): only ASCII digits are accepted.
  Upstream uses `QChar::isDigit()` and also accepts other Unicode decimal
  digits (e.g. Arabic-Indic `١.٥`), which it never writes.
- **`Version`** numbers are parsed with `str::parse::<u32>()` instead of
  `QString::toUInt()`: whitespace around a number (e.g. `"1. 2"`) is
  rejected.

## serialization

- **Integers** (`u32`, `i32`, `i64` values) are parsed with `str::parse()`
  instead of `QString::toUInt()`/`toInt()`/`toLongLong()`: surrounding
  whitespace (only possible in quoted values like `" 42"`) is rejected.
  Signs and leading zeros are accepted like upstream.
- **Floating point values** (only used by importers) are parsed with
  `str::parse()` and must be finite: `inf`/`nan` are rejected (upstream
  accepts them), values that underflow to zero are accepted (upstream
  rejects them), surrounding whitespace is rejected.
- **Child paths** (`SExpression::child("@3")`) parse the index with
  `str::parse::<usize>()` (no surrounding whitespace). Paths are given by
  code, not by files.

### File format migrations

- **v0.1 board outline circles** (layer `brd_outlines`, in boards or
  footprints) are located by their `position` child. Upstream reads the
  first two children of the circle node as coordinates, which fails
  ("Invalid fixed point number string"), so such files cannot be upgraded
  by upstream at all; here they are upgraded as upstream intended.
- **Several devices of one v0.1 component instance** (different devices of
  the same component in several boards) become assembly options in UUID
  order; upstream iterates a `QSet` (hash order, not deterministic across
  runs), so the order of the `device` nodes in `circuit.lp` can differ.
- **Board outlines of equal length** keep their file order when sorted by
  length (stable sort; upstream `std::sort` is unstable), which decides
  which of several equally long v0.1 outlines stays the board outline.
- **Version strings of v0.1 projects** (upstream `toFileProofName()`) are
  decomposed with the `unicode-normalization` crate instead of
  `QString::normalized()`; results only differ where the Unicode versions
  differ.
- **ERC approvals after a project migration** are not cleaned up yet
  (upstream runs the ERC and keeps only approvals of messages which still
  occur); obsolete approvals stay in `circuit/erc.lp` until the ERC is
  ported.
- **Migration log**: the application version in the footer is passed in by
  the application (`ProjectLoader::set_application_version()`, empty by
  default); dates are formatted with `chrono` like Qt's
  `QDate::toString()`/`QTime::toString()` (English names).

## attribute

- **Numeric attribute values** (`AttributeType::is_value_valid()`): checked
  natively instead of with `QString::toFloat()`; the accepted set is
  identical to upstream (verified against Qt 6.11): `inf` with optional sign
  and `nan` without sign (any case), otherwise a finite number within the
  `f32` range that doesn't underflow to zero; surrounding whitespace allowed.
- **Translated type names** (`AttributeType::name_tr()`): looked up in the
  contexts `librepcb::AttrTypeVoltage` etc., where lupdate extracted them.
  Upstream looks them up in the (empty) context `AttributeType` at runtime,
  so it never showed them translated.
- **`AttributeType::valueFromTr()`**: not ported (system locale dependent,
  no callers).
- **Attribute substitution with a filter**: if the filter changes the length
  of a substituted value, upstream continues with stale positions and
  corrupts the text; the port restarts the search behind the filtered value.
  Results without filter, or with a length-preserving filter, are identical.
- **Whitespace** next to removed variables and around keys uses
  `char::is_whitespace()` instead of `QChar::isSpace()` (same character
  set, see "General").

## algorithm

- **Air wires**: the Delaunay triangulation comes from `spade` and the
  minimum spanning forest from `petgraph`. The total air wire length is the
  same, but among several equally long alternatives (e.g. points on a
  regular grid) a different one may be chosen; upstream's choice depends on
  the unstable `std::sort` anyway. Upstream's workarounds for its
  triangulation library (fallback chain edges, manual triangles for 3
  points) are not needed.
- **Net segment simplification**: junctions are merged in ascending anchor
  ID order; upstream iterates a `QHash` (unspecified, per-process random
  order), so the surviving line IDs may differ when several merges are
  possible. The resulting geometry is the same.

## geometry, font

- **Stroke texts are processed per `char`** (`StrokeFont::stroke_line()`),
  upstream per UTF-16 code unit. Only characters outside the Basic
  Multilingual Plane (e.g. emojis) are affected: they are rendered as one
  replacement glyph (U+FFFD) instead of two, which changes the stroke text
  geometry (and thus exports) of such texts.
- **FontoBene parsing** (`font::fontobene`) uses Rust number parsing and
  `str::trim()` instead of `QString::toDouble()`/`toUShort(16)` and
  `QString::trimmed()`: non-finite numbers (`inf`, `nan`) and `0x` prefixed
  codepoints are rejected. Irrelevant for the bundled fonts.
- **Fonts which fail to load** behave like an empty font with letter spacing
  0 and line spacing 9 (the FontoBene defaults). Upstream uses a
  default-constructed header whose spacings are uninitialized.
- Not ported (UI specific, will live in the rendering layer):
  `Path::toQPainterPathPx()`, `Via::toQPainterPathPx()`,
  `PadGeometry::to*QPainterPathPx()`, `Image::tryLoad()`,
  `Toolbox::shapeFromPath()`, `Toolbox::floatToString()`,
  `Toolbox::prettyPrintLocale()`, `Transform::mapPx()`.

## utils

- **Math parser** (user input of lengths/angles/ratios): evaluated with
  `evalexpr` instead of muparser. Same syntax for numbers (locale decimal
  point, `.` always accepted, thousands separators in groups of 3), `+ - * /
  ^`, unary signs, parentheses, muparser's functions (`sin`, `sqrt`, `min`,
  ..., arguments separated by `;`) and constants (`_pi`, `_e`). Differences:
  `^` is left-associative (`2^3^2` = 64, muparser: 512); comparison, logical
  and ternary operators and `rnd()` are not supported; non-ASCII separators
  work (upstream silently ignored them).
- **Overline markup**: `extract_overlines()` returns byte ranges of the
  output string instead of UTF-16 `(start, length)` pairs.
- **`TangentPathJoiner`**: the `timed_out` flag is set whenever the search
  is aborted; upstream misses the flag if the timeout happens in the last
  top-level iteration.
- **`Toolbox::incrementNumberInString()`** wraps on `i32` overflow (like the
  upstream release build of the Rust code, which panics in debug builds).
- **Numeric sorting** (`toolbox::compare_numeric()`, upstream
  `Toolbox::sortNumeric()`): ICU4X's collator for the root locale (numeric
  ordering, secondary strength = case-insensitive, punctuation not ignored)
  instead of `QCollator` with the system ICU and the system locale. Same
  order for typical designators (`R1 < R2 < R10`, `D1 < D1:1 < D2`, case
  ignored); may differ for locales with tailored collation rules (e.g.
  Lithuanian or Estonian letter order) and between ICU/Unicode versions.
  Callers use a stable sort; upstream uses `std::sort`, whose order of
  elements comparing equal (e.g. `r1` vs. `R1`) is unspecified. Affects the
  row order of exported BOM and pick&place files in these edge cases.

## export

- **Gerber attribute values** are truncated to 65535 characters instead of
  65535 UTF-16 code units. Only differs for (object attribute) values longer
  than 65535 code units that contain characters outside the BMP; upstream
  could even cut a surrogate pair in half there.
- **Generation software version and dates** are passed in by the caller
  (`GerberFileInfo`, `Timestamp`) instead of read from
  `Application::getVersion()` and `QDateTime::currentDateTime()`; the
  written format is `QDateTime::toString(Qt::ISODate)` (local time without
  offset, UTC with `Z`, otherwise `+hh:mm`).
- **NFKD normalization** of Gerber attributes and IPC-D-356A strings uses
  `unicode-normalization` instead of Qt; results only differ between
  Unicode versions (for characters new in one of them).
- Invalid paths and failed arc computations are logged with `log` instead of
  `qWarning()`/`qCritical()`; the output is the same.

## sqlite_database

- Uses `rusqlite` (bundled SQLite) instead of the Qt SQL driver; same pragmas
  (`foreign_keys = ON`, WAL journal) and busy timeout (5 s). Queries use
  rusqlite's parameter binding directly.

## fileio

### FilePath

- Paths are stored as UTF-8 `String`; paths which are not valid Unicode are
  rejected (`FilePath::new()` returns `None`). Upstream decodes them lossily
  into a `QString`, i.e. they would not work anyway.
- Ordering is `str` ordering (code points) instead of `QString` ordering
  (UTF-16 code units). Only differs between non-BMP characters and
  U+E000..U+FFFF; nothing on disk depends on it.
- Cleaning uses `std::path` component semantics (via `path-clean`) instead
  of `QDir::cleanPath()`: `..` above the root is dropped (`/../a` → `/a`),
  Windows prefixes (drives, UNC, verbatim) are parsed by `std`.
- `is_located_in_dir()` works for the root directory (upstream appends `/`
  unconditionally, so nothing is ever located in `/`).
- `to_unique()` uses `dunce::canonicalize()` (no `\\?\` prefix on Windows).

### file_utils (upstream FileUtils)

- `write_file()` is atomic like `QSaveFile` (temporary file in the same
  directory, then rename), but the temporary file is named `.XXXXXX.tmp`
  instead of `<name>.XXXXXX`. Permissions of existing files are kept, new
  files get `0666 & ~umask` like upstream.
- `files_in_directory()` name filters use `glob` syntax (`*`, `?`, `[...]`,
  negation with `[!...]`), case-insensitive; Qt wildcards negate with
  `[^...]` as well.
- Listing errors (unreadable subdirectories) are returned as errors instead
  of being silently skipped.
- `temp_dir()` (upstream `Application::getTempDir()`): if
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset on Unix, falls back to the system temporary
  directory instead of Qt's `/tmp/runtime-$USER`.

### TransactionalFileSystem

- `clean_path()` converts `\` to `/` *before* resolving `..`. Upstream (on
  Unix) resolves `..` first, so `a\..\..\x` passed the sandbox check and was
  resolved outside the root later by `FilePath` — a sandbox breakout. A
  leading `/` is ignored, so `/../x` is rejected (Qt may resolve it to the
  root). Trimming uses `str::trim()` (Unicode White_Space).
- `dirs()` / `files()` return sorted lists (upstream: `QSet` order).
- Entries in the backup/autosave index files are sorted by `str` ordering
  (upstream: UTF-16 order); only differs for non-BMP file names and does not
  affect reading.
- `load_from_zip*()` reads all entries before writing any, so a corrupt
  archive does not leave a partially loaded state.

### DirectoryLock / system_info

The lock file format and status logic are identical. Values which can
differ between platforms/implementations:

- Line 1 (full user name) is informational only: taken from
  `whoami::realname()`. On macOS upstream runs `finger`, on Windows it falls
  back to parsing `net user` output.
- Line 5 (process name) and the stale-lock check: identical on Linux
  (`/proc/<pid>/exe`). On macOS/Windows/BSD the name comes from `sysinfo`
  (executable file name, on Windows without extension) instead of
  `proc_name()` / `QueryFullProcessImageNameW()`; long macOS process names
  may therefore differ from what a C++ instance wrote, which makes a running
  C++ instance look like a stale lock to a Rust instance (and vice versa).
  Solaris/OpenBSD are not supported by `sysinfo` (processes always look
  stopped).
- PIDs `<= 0` or `> i32::MAX` in a lock file are treated as "not running"
  (upstream passes them to `kill()`, where `<= 0` means process groups).

### ZIP

- `ZipArchive::extract_to()` uses `zip` 8.x extraction (rejects unsafe paths,
  handles symlinks safely) instead of `zip` 0.6.6.
- Entries > 4 GiB are written as ZIP64.

### CsvFile

- A record consisting of a single empty value is written as `""` (by the
  `csv` crate) instead of an empty line.
- Trailing whitespace of comment lines is trimmed with
  `char::is_whitespace()` instead of `QChar::isSpace()`.

### OutputDirectoryWriter

- Index lines are sorted by `str` ordering (upstream: UTF-16 order).
- `remove_unknown_files()` removes empty parent directories only inside the
  output directory (upstream `QDir::rmpath()` may also remove empty
  directories above it).

## library, rule_check

- **URLs** (library URL, resource URLs, organization and PCB design rules
  URLs) are stored verbatim as strings. Upstream parses them with
  `QUrl(…, QUrl::StrictMode)` and writes `toString(QUrl::PrettyDecoded)`
  (library, organization: an empty string if the URL is invalid). Files
  written by upstream are always normalized, so they round-trip
  identically; a hand-edited, non-normalized or invalid URL is written back
  unchanged instead of being normalized or cleared. **File output can
  differ** in that case.
- **Old file formats**: elements in a file format older than the current
  one are rejected (`Error::MigrationRequired`) since the file format
  migrations are not ported yet. Upstream upgrades them when opening.
- **Title case check** (`is_title_case()`, `title_case_fixed_name()`):
  "lowercase letter" is general category Ll (upstream `QChar::isLetter() &&
  isLower()` on UTF-16 code units, identical for BMP names). The fixed name
  converts a letter only if it has a single-character uppercase mapping
  (Rust `char::to_uppercase()`), like `QChar::toUpper()`; results can differ
  only where the Unicode versions of Rust and Qt differ.
- **Pin names in "Overlapping pins: …"** are sorted by natural order
  (`alphanumeric-sort`, case-insensitive), upstream by `QCollator` in numeric
  mode (ICU). Both order digit sequences numerically ("A2" < "A10"); they
  can differ in the relative order of punctuation characters (pin names are
  circuit identifiers, i.e. ASCII letters, digits and `-._+/!?&@#$()`).
- **Message order**: the overlapping pins messages are emitted in order of
  the first pin of each position (upstream: `QHash` iteration order, i.e.
  unspecified). `librepcb-cli` sorts the messages, so its output is not
  affected.
- **Image check** (port of `Image::tryLoad()`): PNG and JPEG files are
  decoded with the `image` crate (only the format given by the file
  extension is tried, like `QImage::loadFromData()` with a format), SVG
  files are parsed with `usvg` and must have a default size of at least 1×1
  pixels (rounded) like with `QSvgRenderer`. Files which one decoder accepts
  and the other rejects (e.g. truncated or exotic PNG/JPEG variants, SVGs
  that `usvg` cannot parse) give different results; the error details in
  the message description are not the Qt texts. Like upstream, empty image
  files are reported as read error ("Failed to read image file").
- **DRC settings sources** (`BoardDesignRuleCheckSettings`, currently in
  `library::org`) keep their insertion order; upstream stores them in a
  `std::unordered_set` and writes multiple sources in unspecified order.
  Sources are always empty in organizations.
- **`Organization::duplicate_from()`** copies the output jobs with new UUIDs;
  upstream clears the job lists before iterating over them and thus drops
  all jobs of the duplicate. Output jobs are kept as raw S-expression nodes
  until `OutputJob` is ported (written back unchanged).
- **`Component::duplicate_from()`**: a pin-signal-map entry referring to a
  non-existent signal becomes unconnected (upstream: undefined behavior).
- **Package check geometry** (pad clearances, legend clearance, annular
  rings, pad origin): upstream decides with `QPainterPath::intersects()` /
  `contains()`, whose curve approximations (e.g. only 3 samples per quarter
  circle of a pad corner in `QPathClipper`) change the results of real
  libraries by tens of µm. These predicates, `QPainterPathStroker` (square
  caps, bevel joins) and `Transform::mapPx()` are ported in
  `utils::painter_path` and give the same results as upstream on all test
  libraries, the official LibrePCB libraries and 12,000 random cases near
  the thresholds. Remaining differences: the rotation of pads by other
  angles than multiples of 90° uses `libm` instead of the platform's
  `sin`/`cos`, and the union of multi-segment slot outlines
  (`QPainterPath::united()`) is approximated by the outlines with winding
  fill. Both can only matter if a distance is within about 1 nm of a check
  threshold.
- Not ported (UI specific, will live in the rendering layer):
  `FootprintPainter`.

## network (crate librepcb-network)

- Async (tokio/reqwest); progress is a `watch` channel, so intermediate
  progress states may be coalesced (upstream emits every signal).
- The HTTP disk cache is not ported (`setCacheLoadControl()`,
  `setMinimumCacheTime()`, `AlwaysCache`); `ApiEndpoint`'s `forceNoCache`
  parameter is therefore dropped.
- User agent: `LibrePCB/<version> (<os>; <arch>; <locale>)` (upstream:
  `LibrePCB/<version> (<pretty OS name>; <arch>; <locale>) Qt/<version>`).
- Error messages: HTTP errors read
  `Error transferring <url> - server replied: <reason> (<HTTP status>)`;
  upstream appends the `QNetworkReply::NetworkError` number instead of the
  HTTP status. `file://` errors read `Error opening <path>: <OS error>` with
  the Rust I/O error text.
- `NetworkRequest` aborts as soon as the 100 MB limit is exceeded instead of
  downloading everything first.
- `Content-Length` of POST requests is always set automatically.
- `FileDownload`: if moving the extracted directory into place fails, the
  backup is restored and an error is returned (upstream restores the backup
  but reports success). A ZIP discovery callback returning a path outside
  the temporary directory is an error (upstream: assertion).
- `ApiEndpoint`: a library entry with a field of the wrong JSON type (e.g.
  `"recommended": "yes"`) is skipped as a whole; missing and `null` fields
  default to empty values like upstream.
- `OrderPcbApiRequest`: the JSON upload body is compact instead of indented;
  the "project is too large" message formats the size like
  `formatFileSize()` (`"1.50 MB"`) instead of
  `QLocale::formattedDataSize()` (`"2 MiB"`).

## project/schematic

- Loading validates each schematic page as a whole after deserializing it
  (upstream adds the empty page and then item by item); for a file with
  several errors, the reported error can differ. Messages are upstream's.
- Removing a symbol with connected pins, a junction with lines, a bus
  junction or bus segment with attached net lines, or changing the net/bus
  of a non-empty segment fails with an `ItemInUse` error message (upstream:
  `LogicError` without message).
- `DuplicateUuid` messages use "a" for every item kind ("There is already a
  image ..."; upstream: "an image").
- Pin numbers text (`SymbolPinView::numbers_text()`): the 8 character
  truncation counts the text built so far; upstream accidentally counts the
  previously cached text, so its result depends on the history of pad name
  updates. Display only.
- The inverse of adding a non-empty schematic page is a batch removing its
  items first (a page can only be removed when empty, like upstream).

## project/board

- Loading rejects duplicate item UUIDs first and then validates each board
  as a whole (upstream adds the empty board and then item by item); for a
  file with several errors, the reported error can differ. Messages are
  upstream's.
- The `lock` flag of planes is loaded. Upstream's
  `ProjectLoader::loadBoardPlane()` does not read it, so upstream saves a
  locked plane as unlocked after opening the project; we keep the flag.
  File output differs only for locked planes.
- Removing, mirroring or replacing the library device/footprint of a device
  with connected traces, changing the net of a segment with vias, junctions
  or traces, and adding a device of a schematic-only component fail with an
  error message (`ItemInUse`, `SchematicOnlyComponent`; upstream:
  `LogicError` without message).
- Updating net segment elements in place (`UpdateNetSegmentElements`) may
  change the layer of a connected trace, the layers of a via or the side of
  a standalone pad as long as the result is valid; upstream only allows
  `BI_NetLine::setLayer()` on traces not added to the board (the editor
  removes and re-adds them). Resulting files are the same.
- Air wires are rebuilt on request (`Project::rebuild_air_wires()`, called by
  the loader for each board and by the editor after each command) from the
  nets marked dirty by the mutations, a superset of upstream's
  `scheduleAirWiresRebuild()` calls (e.g. also when only traces change).
  The anchors are added in a deterministic order, and ties between equally
  long air wires can be resolved differently (see algorithm). Display and
  DRC "missing connection" approvals only.
- The DRC approval cleanup (`Board::updateDrcMessageApprovals()`) is not
  ported yet (part of the DRC).
- `BoardNetSegmentSplitter`: new junction UUIDs come from a caller provided
  generator, and the elements of a resulting segment may be listed in
  another order. Files are unaffected (elements are saved sorted by UUID).

## project (ERC, attribute lookup, BOM, JSON export)

- ERC (`project::erc`): where upstream iterates a `QHash`/`QSet` (nets
  attached to a bus) or a registration list (net segments of a net: here
  schematic page order, then segment UUID order; bus segments of a bus:
  schematic UUID order, then segment UUID order; symbol pins of a
  component signal: gate order), items are visited in a deterministic
  order. This only affects the order of the messages and which of several
  equivalent items a message location (highlighting) points to; the
  messages and approvals (`circuit/erc.lp`) are identical. Symbols whose
  pins cannot be computed from the project library are skipped (the loader
  rejects such projects, upstream cannot represent them at all).
- `ProjectAttributeLookup` borrows the project and the objects (upstream:
  `QPointer`s which silently yield empty values after deletion). Built-in
  keys whose library element is missing from the project library
  (`COMPONENT`, `DEVICE`, `PACKAGE`, `FOOTPRINT`) resolve to an empty
  string (upstream cannot represent that state). `PROJECT_DIRPATH` and
  `PROJECT_FILEPATH` are empty for projects not on disk. `CREATED_DATE`,
  `CREATED_TIME`, `DATE` and `TIME` are formatted with chrono in local
  time (`%Y-%m-%d`, `%H:%M:%S`), the same text as Qt's `ISODate`.
- `BomGenerator`: the value cleanup uses the `regex` crate with ASCII `\s`,
  the same set as upstream's `QRegularExpression` without Unicode
  properties; `QString::simplified()` is `split_whitespace()` (see
  General).
- `json_export`: the output is written by a port of `QJsonDocument`'s
  indented format and of Qt 6's `QByteArray::number(d, 'g',
  FloatingPointShortest)` (shortest round-trip digits, exponent form like
  `1e-05` only where shorter). Older Qt versions may format numbers in
  exponent form differently; lengths realistically exported (multiples of
  1 nm between 0.001 mm and 1 m) are formatted identically. Keys are sorted
  like `QJsonObject`.
