# Intentional divergences from upstream LibrePCB

Behavior differences of the Rust port compared to the C++ reference
(`../LibrePCB`), including exotic edge cases, usually because upstream relies
on Qt semantics that are not reproduced. File formats are unaffected unless
stated otherwise. Entries are grouped by module.

## General

- **Whitespace**: `char::is_whitespace()` / `str::trim()` /
  `str::split_whitespace()` replace `QChar::isSpace()` /
  `QString::trimmed()` / `QString::simplified()`. Both use the same set
  (Unicode White_Space = categories Zs, Zl, Zp plus `\t`..`\r` and U+0085),
  so results are identical apart from Unicode version differences.
- **String ordering** is `str` ordering (code points) instead of `QString`
  ordering (UTF-16 code units). The two only differ when comparing
  characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane with U+E000..U+FFFF.
  Affected: `SExpression`'s `Ord` impl, `PcbColor::all()` (sorted by
  translated name), and the file lists noted under fileio below.
- **Transcendental functions** (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `acos`, `atan`,
  `atan2`, `hypot`, the math parser functions) come from the `libm` crate in
  `librepcb-core` and `clipper`, so results are identical on all platforms.
  Upstream calls the platform C library (glibc, MSVC CRT, ...) except for
  the functions it routes through its own Rust code (`Point::rotated()`,
  arc radius/center), which already use `libm`. `libm` differs from glibc
  in the last bit for some inputs (1–18% of random inputs, depending on the
  function); none of the test vectors captured with glibc/upstream (Clipper
  golden vectors incl. round and square offsets, upstream arc flattening
  and geometry tests, round-trip files) changed after rounding to integer
  coordinates. A different result
  would require an intermediate value within one ulp of a rounding
  boundary. `sqrt` and basic arithmetic stay native (correctly rounded
  everywhere). Exception: `^` in the math parser is evaluated by `evalexpr`
  with `f64::powf()` (platform library).

## types

- **`ElementName` / `SimpleString` validity** is expressed natively: at most
  70 characters (`ElementName` only), BMP characters only, no characters of
  general category Control, Format, Surrogate, Private Use or Unassigned.
  This is exactly the set upstream accepts (`QString::length() <= 70` and
  `QChar::isPrint()` per UTF-16 code unit, which rejects surrogates).
- **Decimal numbers in files** (`Length`, `Angle`, `Ratio`, ... via
  `decimal_fixed_point_from_string()`): only ASCII digits are accepted.
  Upstream uses `QChar::isDigit()` and also accepts other Unicode decimal
  digits (e.g. Arabic-Indic `١.٥`), which it never writes.
- **`Version`** numbers are parsed with `str::parse::<u32>()` instead of
  `QString::toUInt()`: whitespace around a number (e.g. `"1. 2"`) is
  rejected.

## serialization

- **Integers** (`u32`, `i32`, `i64` values) are parsed with `str::parse()`
  instead of `QString::toUInt()`/`toInt()`/`toLongLong()`: surrounding
  whitespace (only possible in quoted values like `" 42"`) is rejected.
  Signs and leading zeros are accepted like upstream.
- **Floating point values** (only used by importers) are parsed with
  `str::parse()` and must be finite: `inf`/`nan` are rejected (upstream
  accepts them), values that underflow to zero are accepted (upstream
  rejects them), surrounding whitespace is rejected.
- **Child paths** (`SExpression::child("@3")`) parse the index with
  `str::parse::<usize>()` (no surrounding whitespace). Paths are given by
  code, not by files.

### File format migrations

- **v0.1 board outline circles** (layer `brd_outlines`, in boards or
  footprints) are located by their `position` child. Upstream reads the
  first two children of the circle node as coordinates, which fails
  ("Invalid fixed point number string"), so such files cannot be upgraded
  by upstream at all; here they are upgraded as upstream intended.
- **Several devices of one v0.1 component instance** (different devices of
  the same component in several boards) become assembly options in UUID
  order; upstream iterates a `QSet` (hash order, not deterministic across
  runs), so the order of the `device` nodes in `circuit.lp` can differ.
- **Board outlines of equal length** keep their file order when sorted by
  length (stable sort; upstream `std::sort` is unstable), which decides
  which of several equally long v0.1 outlines stays the board outline.
- **Version strings of v0.1 projects** (upstream `toFileProofName()`) are
  decomposed with the `unicode-normalization` crate instead of
  `QString::normalized()`; results only differ where the Unicode versions
  differ.
- **Migration log**: the application version in the footer is passed in by
  the application (`ProjectLoader::set_application_version()`, empty by
  default); dates are formatted with `chrono` like Qt's
  `QDate::toString()`/`QTime::toString()` (English names).

## attribute

- **Numeric attribute values** (`AttributeType::is_value_valid()`): checked
  natively instead of with `QString::toFloat()`; the accepted set is
  identical to upstream (verified against Qt 6.11): `inf` with optional sign
  and `nan` without sign (any case), otherwise a finite number within the
  `f32` range that doesn't underflow to zero; surrounding whitespace allowed.
- **Translated type names** (`AttributeType::name_tr()`): looked up in the
  contexts `librepcb::AttrTypeVoltage` etc., where lupdate extracted them.
  Upstream looks them up in the (empty) context `AttributeType` at runtime,
  so it never showed them translated.
- **`AttributeType::valueFromTr()`**: not ported (system locale dependent,
  no callers).
- **Attribute substitution with a filter**: if the filter changes the length
  of a substituted value, upstream continues with stale positions and
  corrupts the text; the port restarts the search behind the filtered value.
  Results without filter, or with a length-preserving filter, are identical.
- **Whitespace** next to removed variables and around keys uses
  `char::is_whitespace()` instead of `QChar::isSpace()` (same character
  set, see "General").

## algorithm

- **Air wires**: ported literally, including upstream's Delaunay
  triangulation library (with its single precision circumcircle test),
  the fallback edges and libstdc++'s `std::sort()` (`clipper::std_sort`),
  so the same air wires are chosen among equally long alternatives as by
  upstream built with GCC/libstdc++ (the DRC "missing connection"
  approvals depend on it). Upstream built with another standard library
  (MSVC, libc++) may choose differently.
- **Net segment simplification**: junctions are merged in ascending anchor
  ID order; upstream iterates a `QHash` (unspecified, per-process random
  order), so the surviving line IDs may differ when several merges are
  possible. The resulting geometry is the same.

## geometry, font

- **Stroke texts are processed per `char`** (`StrokeFont::stroke_line()`),
  upstream per UTF-16 code unit. Only characters outside the Basic
  Multilingual Plane (e.g. emojis) are affected: they are rendered as one
  replacement glyph (U+FFFD) instead of two, which changes the stroke text
  geometry (and thus exports) of such texts.
- **FontoBene parsing** (`font::fontobene`) uses Rust number parsing and
  `str::trim()` instead of `QString::toDouble()`/`toUShort(16)` and
  `QString::trimmed()`: non-finite numbers (`inf`, `nan`) and `0x` prefixed
  codepoints are rejected. Irrelevant for the bundled fonts.
- **Fonts which fail to load** behave like an empty font with letter spacing
  0 and line spacing 9 (the FontoBene defaults). Upstream uses a
  default-constructed header whose spacings are uninitialized.
- Not ported (UI specific, will live in the rendering layer):
  `Path::toQPainterPathPx()`, `Via::toQPainterPathPx()`,
  `PadGeometry::to*QPainterPathPx()`, `Image::tryLoad()`,
  `Toolbox::shapeFromPath()`, `Toolbox::floatToString()`,
  `Toolbox::prettyPrintLocale()`, `Transform::mapPx()`.

## utils

- **Math parser** (user input of lengths/angles/ratios): evaluated with
  `evalexpr` instead of muparser. Same syntax for numbers (locale decimal
  point, `.` always accepted, thousands separators in groups of 3), `+ - * /
  ^`, unary signs, parentheses, muparser's functions (`sin`, `sqrt`, `min`,
  ..., arguments separated by `;`) and constants (`_pi`, `_e`). Differences:
  `^` is left-associative (`2^3^2` = 64, muparser: 512); comparison, logical
  and ternary operators and `rnd()` are not supported; non-ASCII separators
  work (upstream silently ignored them).
- **Overline markup**: `extract_overlines()` returns byte ranges of the
  output string instead of UTF-16 `(start, length)` pairs.
- **`TangentPathJoiner`**: the `timed_out` flag is set whenever the search
  is aborted; upstream misses the flag if the timeout happens in the last
  top-level iteration.
- **`Toolbox::incrementNumberInString()`** wraps on `i32` overflow (like the
  upstream release build of the Rust code, which panics in debug builds).
- **Numeric sorting** (`toolbox::compare_numeric()`, upstream
  `Toolbox::sortNumeric()`): ICU4X's collator for the root locale (numeric
  ordering, secondary strength = case-insensitive, punctuation not ignored)
  instead of `QCollator` with the system ICU and the system locale. Same
  order for typical designators (`R1 < R2 < R10`, `D1 < D1:1 < D2`, case
  ignored); may differ for locales with tailored collation rules (e.g.
  Lithuanian or Estonian letter order) and between ICU/Unicode versions.
  Callers use a stable sort; upstream uses `std::sort`, whose order of
  elements comparing equal (e.g. `r1` vs. `R1`) is unspecified. Affects the
  row order of exported BOM and pick&place files in these edge cases.

## export

- **Gerber attribute values** are truncated to 65535 characters instead of
  65535 UTF-16 code units. Only differs for (object attribute) values longer
  than 65535 code units that contain characters outside the BMP; upstream
  could even cut a surrogate pair in half there.
- **Generation software version and dates** are passed in by the caller
  (`GerberFileInfo`, `Timestamp`) instead of read from
  `Application::getVersion()` and `QDateTime::currentDateTime()`; the
  written format is `QDateTime::toString(Qt::ISODate)` (local time without
  offset, UTC with `Z`, otherwise `+hh:mm`).
- **NFKD normalization** of Gerber attributes and IPC-D-356A strings uses
  `unicode-normalization` instead of Qt; results only differ between
  Unicode versions (for characters new in one of them).
- Invalid paths and failed arc computations are logged with `log` instead of
  `qWarning()`/`qCritical()`; the output is the same.
- **`GraphicsExportSettings`** is plain data: the page size is its
  `QPageSize` key string, and the painting helpers (`getFillColor()`,
  `convertImageColors()`) are not ported. Color schemes are not in core
  yet, so the default colors of `BaseColorScheme::schematicLibrePcbLight()`
  and `boardLibrePcbDark()` are embedded (`load_default_colors()` replaces
  `loadColorsFromScheme()`). The adjustment of board colors for white
  backgrounds deliberately ports Qt 6's `QColor` HSV conversion (single
  precision, 16 bit channels, `qt_div_257()` rounding), because the
  resulting colors are written to `jobs.lp` by the default graphics jobs.

- **Graphics export** (port of `GraphicsExport`, `GraphicsPainter` and the
  painters, in the scene crate as `librepcb_scene::export`): no Qt, so the
  written bytes differ completely from upstream's `QPdfWriter`,
  `QSvgGenerator` and `QImageWriter` output. The page layout follows
  upstream (fixed or content-derived page size, orientation incl. the
  automatic one, margins, rotation, mirroring, fixed scale or fit,
  background, minimum line width, black/white, one PDF with all pages,
  numbered SVG/image files for several pages, output directory creation,
  error messages). Differences:
  - PDF: vector paths through `pdf-writer` at the page size in points
    (upstream: 1200 DPI device units); creator and producer are
    `LibrePCB <version>` (upstream producer: Qt). No invisible texts for
    selection/search (upstream draws transparent TrueType texts on boards
    and footprints), no embedded fonts (all texts are stroke paths, see
    scene).
  - SVG: hand-written, one `<path>` per paint, `<desc>Generated with
    LibrePCB</desc>`; size in millimeters rounded to 0.1 µm.
  - Images: PNG, JPEG and BMP only (upstream: every Qt image format), via
    vello_cpu and the `image` crate; anti-aliasing differs. JPEG/BMP drop
    the alpha channel like Qt (transparent areas become black).
  - The source rectangle (upstream `QPicture::boundingRect()`) is the
    bounding box of the paths plus half the stroke widths; Qt's is
    slightly larger (about 0.3 mm on a schematic page), so derived page
    sizes can differ by a few points.
  - Page sizes are Qt 6's `QPageSize` table (`PageSize`); the page size in
    whole points is used for all output devices.
  - Pages with nothing to paint get the device's real-size scale instead
    of Qt's infinite fit scale.
  - Unknown extensions fail before painting (upstream paints the page
    first, then fails to save it); the message is the same.
  - Printing, previews and the asynchronous API (progress signals,
    cancellation, clipboard) are not ported.
- **Interactive HTML BOM** (`InteractiveHtmlBom`): generated by the
  `interactive-html-bom` crate in the same version as upstream (0.2.0),
  with the same conversions as upstream's C++/FFI wrapper (`f32`
  millimeters, Y axis negated as floating point value, so zero becomes
  `-0`), so the HTML is byte-identical (verified against `librepcb-cli`
  on all test projects, `tests/unittests/compat/interactive_html_bom.rs`). `add_footprint()`
  returns an error if a pad outline cannot be calculated (upstream's
  `noexcept` method would terminate the application).

## job

- **Class hierarchy → enum:** `OutputJob` holds UUID, name and options,
  and `OutputJobKind` the type specific settings (one struct per upstream
  subclass, plain data with public fields). Signals and icons are not
  ported. Output is identical.
- **Copies keep the forward compatibility options:** upstream's
  `OutputJob` copy constructor (used by `cloneShared()`, e.g. when copying
  a job in the output jobs dialog) drops the `option` nodes of the base
  job; `Clone` keeps them. Only differs for copied jobs of a future minor
  version with options.
- **Ordering of options and layer colors** (upstream `QMap<QString, ...>`)
  is `str` ordering, see "String ordering" under General.
- **Colors** (`layer`/`background` of graphics jobs) are parsed with
  `Color` (hex forms only, see types); `QColor` also accepts SVG color
  names, which LibrePCB never writes.
- **Default job set:** upstream creates it in the editor's output jobs
  dialog; here it is `job::default_output_jobs()` in core, taking the
  Gerber settings and custom BOM attributes as parameters.

## sqlite_database

- Uses `rusqlite` (bundled SQLite) instead of the Qt SQL driver; same pragmas
  (`foreign_keys = ON`, WAL journal) and busy timeout (5 s). Queries use
  rusqlite's parameter binding directly.

## fileio

### FilePath

- Paths are stored as UTF-8 `String`; paths which are not valid Unicode are
  rejected (`FilePath::new()` returns `None`). Upstream decodes them lossily
  into a `QString`, i.e. they would not work anyway.
- Ordering is `str` ordering (code points) instead of `QString` ordering
  (UTF-16 code units). Only differs between non-BMP characters and
  U+E000..U+FFFF; nothing on disk depends on it.
- Cleaning uses `std::path` component semantics (via `path-clean`) instead
  of `QDir::cleanPath()`: `..` above the root is dropped (`/../a` → `/a`),
  Windows prefixes (drives, UNC, verbatim) are parsed by `std`.
- `is_located_in_dir()` works for the root directory (upstream appends `/`
  unconditionally, so nothing is ever located in `/`).
- `to_unique()` uses `dunce::canonicalize()` (no `\\?\` prefix on Windows).

### file_utils (upstream FileUtils)

- `write_file()` is atomic like `QSaveFile` (temporary file in the same
  directory, then rename), but the temporary file is named `.XXXXXX.tmp`
  instead of `<name>.XXXXXX`. Permissions of existing files are kept, new
  files get `0666 & ~umask` like upstream.
- `files_in_directory()` name filters use `glob` syntax (`*`, `?`, `[...]`,
  negation with `[!...]`), case-insensitive; Qt wildcards negate with
  `[^...]` as well.
- Listing errors (unreadable subdirectories) are returned as errors instead
  of being silently skipped.
- `temp_dir()` (upstream `Application::getTempDir()`): if
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset on Unix, falls back to the system temporary
  directory instead of Qt's `/tmp/runtime-$USER`.

### TransactionalFileSystem

- `clean_path()` converts `\` to `/` *before* resolving `..`. Upstream (on
  Unix) resolves `..` first, so `a\..\..\x` passed the sandbox check and was
  resolved outside the root later by `FilePath` — a sandbox breakout. A
  leading `/` is ignored, so `/../x` is rejected (Qt may resolve it to the
  root). Trimming uses `str::trim()` (Unicode White_Space).
- `dirs()` / `files()` return sorted lists (upstream: `QSet` order).
- Entries in the backup/autosave index files are sorted by `str` ordering
  (upstream: UTF-16 order); only differs for non-BMP file names and does not
  affect reading.
- `load_from_zip*()` reads all entries before writing any, so a corrupt
  archive does not leave a partially loaded state.

### DirectoryLock / system_info

The lock file format and status logic are identical. Values which can
differ between platforms/implementations:

- Line 1 (full user name) is informational only: taken from
  `whoami::realname()`. On macOS upstream runs `finger`, on Windows it falls
  back to parsing `net user` output.
- Line 5 (process name) and the stale-lock check: identical on Linux
  (`/proc/<pid>/exe`). On macOS/Windows/BSD the name comes from `sysinfo`
  (executable file name, on Windows without extension) instead of
  `proc_name()` / `QueryFullProcessImageNameW()`; long macOS process names
  may therefore differ from what a C++ instance wrote, which makes a running
  C++ instance look like a stale lock to a Rust instance (and vice versa).
  Solaris/OpenBSD are not supported by `sysinfo` (processes always look
  stopped).
- PIDs `<= 0` or `> i32::MAX` in a lock file are treated as "not running"
  (upstream passes them to `kill()`, where `<= 0` means process groups).

### ZIP

- `ZipArchive::extract_to()` uses `zip` 8.x extraction (rejects unsafe paths,
  handles symlinks safely) instead of `zip` 0.6.6.
- Entries > 4 GiB are written as ZIP64.

### CsvFile

- A record consisting of a single empty value is written as `""` (by the
  `csv` crate) instead of an empty line.
- Trailing whitespace of comment lines is trimmed with
  `char::is_whitespace()` instead of `QChar::isSpace()`.

### OutputDirectoryWriter

- Index lines are sorted by `str` ordering (upstream: UTF-16 order).
- `remove_unknown_files()` removes empty parent directories only inside the
  output directory (upstream `QDir::rmpath()` may also remove empty
  directories above it).

## library, rule_check

- **URLs** (library URL, resource URLs, organization and PCB design rules
  URLs) are stored verbatim as strings. Upstream parses them with
  `QUrl(…, QUrl::StrictMode)` and writes `toString(QUrl::PrettyDecoded)`
  (library, organization: an empty string if the URL is invalid). Files
  written by upstream are always normalized, so they round-trip
  identically; a hand-edited, non-normalized or invalid URL is written back
  unchanged instead of being normalized or cleared. **File output can
  differ** in that case.
- **Title case check** (`is_title_case()`, `title_case_fixed_name()`):
  "lowercase letter" is general category Ll (upstream `QChar::isLetter() &&
  isLower()` on UTF-16 code units, identical for BMP names). The fixed name
  converts a letter only if it has a single-character uppercase mapping
  (Rust `char::to_uppercase()`), like `QChar::toUpper()`; results can differ
  only where the Unicode versions of Rust and Qt differ.
- **Pin names in "Overlapping pins: …"** are sorted by natural order
  (`alphanumeric-sort`, case-insensitive), upstream by `QCollator` in numeric
  mode (ICU). Both order digit sequences numerically ("A2" < "A10"); they
  can differ in the relative order of punctuation characters (pin names are
  circuit identifiers, i.e. ASCII letters, digits and `-._+/!?&@#$()`).
- **Message order**: the overlapping pins messages are emitted in order of
  the first pin of each position (upstream: `QHash` iteration order, i.e.
  unspecified). `librepcb-cli` sorts the messages, so its output is not
  affected.
- **Image check** (port of `Image::tryLoad()`): PNG and JPEG files are
  decoded with the `image` crate (only the format given by the file
  extension is tried, like `QImage::loadFromData()` with a format), SVG
  files are parsed with `usvg` and must have a default size of at least 1×1
  pixels (rounded) like with `QSvgRenderer`. Files which one decoder accepts
  and the other rejects (e.g. truncated or exotic PNG/JPEG variants, SVGs
  that `usvg` cannot parse) give different results; the error details in
  the message description are not the Qt texts. Like upstream, empty image
  files are reported as read error ("Failed to read image file").
- **DRC settings sources** (`BoardDesignRuleCheckSettings`, currently in
  `library::org`) keep their insertion order; upstream stores them in a
  `std::unordered_set` and writes multiple sources in unspecified order.
  Sources are always empty in organizations.
- **`Organization::duplicate_from()`** copies the output jobs with new UUIDs;
  upstream clears the job lists before iterating over them and thus drops
  all jobs of the duplicate.
- **`Component::duplicate_from()`**: a pin-signal-map entry referring to a
  non-existent signal becomes unconnected (upstream: undefined behavior).
- **Package check geometry** (pad clearances, legend clearance, annular
  rings, pad origin): upstream decides with `QPainterPath::intersects()` /
  `contains()`, whose curve approximations (e.g. only 3 samples per quarter
  circle of a pad corner in `QPathClipper`) change the results of real
  libraries by tens of µm. These predicates, `QPainterPathStroker` (square
  caps, bevel joins) and `Transform::mapPx()` are ported in
  `utils::painter_path` and give the same results as upstream on all test
  libraries, the official LibrePCB libraries and 12,000 random cases near
  the thresholds. Remaining differences: the rotation of pads by other
  angles than multiples of 90° uses `libm` instead of the platform's
  `sin`/`cos`, and the union of multi-segment slot outlines
  (`QPainterPath::united()`) is approximated by the outlines with winding
  fill. Both can only matter if a distance is within about 1 nm of a check
  threshold.
- Not ported (UI specific, will live in the rendering layer):
  `FootprintPainter`.

## network (crate librepcb-network)

- Async (tokio/reqwest); progress is a `watch` channel, so intermediate
  progress states may be coalesced (upstream emits every signal).
- The HTTP disk cache is not ported (`setCacheLoadControl()`,
  `setMinimumCacheTime()`, `AlwaysCache`); `ApiEndpoint`'s `forceNoCache`
  parameter is therefore dropped.
- User agent: `LibrePCB/<version> (<os>; <arch>; <locale>)` (upstream:
  `LibrePCB/<version> (<pretty OS name>; <arch>; <locale>) Qt/<version>`).
- Error messages: HTTP errors read
  `Error transferring <url> - server replied: <reason> (<HTTP status>)`;
  upstream appends the `QNetworkReply::NetworkError` number instead of the
  HTTP status. `file://` errors read `Error opening <path>: <OS error>` with
  the Rust I/O error text.
- `NetworkRequest` aborts as soon as the 100 MB limit is exceeded instead of
  downloading everything first.
- `Content-Length` of POST requests is always set automatically.
- `FileDownload`: if moving the extracted directory into place fails, the
  backup is restored and an error is returned (upstream restores the backup
  but reports success). A ZIP discovery callback returning a path outside
  the temporary directory is an error (upstream: assertion).
- `ApiEndpoint`: a library entry with a field of the wrong JSON type (e.g.
  `"recommended": "yes"`) is skipped as a whole; missing and `null` fields
  default to empty values like upstream.
- `OrderPcbApiRequest`: the JSON upload body is compact instead of indented;
  the "project is too large" message formats the size like
  `formatFileSize()` (`"1.50 MB"`) instead of
  `QLocale::formattedDataSize()` (`"2 MiB"`).

- `LibraryDownload` (upstream in the editor) is part of this crate; it
  returns the library directory or an error instead of emitting
  `finished(bool, QString)`. The library installer (`library_installer`,
  selecting libraries by name/UUID with their dependencies) has no upstream
  counterpart; upstream does this in the library manager UI.

## project/schematic

- Loading validates each schematic page as a whole after deserializing it
  (upstream adds the empty page and then item by item); for a file with
  several errors, the reported error can differ. Messages are upstream's.
- Removing a symbol with connected pins, a junction with lines, a bus
  junction or bus segment with attached net lines, or changing the net/bus
  of a non-empty segment fails with an `ItemInUse` error message (upstream:
  `LogicError` without message).
- `DuplicateUuid` messages use "a" for every item kind ("There is already a
  image ..."; upstream: "an image").
- Pin numbers text (`SymbolPinView::numbers_text()`): the 8 character
  truncation counts the text built so far; upstream accidentally counts the
  previously cached text, so its result depends on the history of pad name
  updates. Display only.
- The inverse of adding a non-empty schematic page is a batch removing its
  items first (a page can only be removed when empty, like upstream).

## project/board

- Loading rejects duplicate item UUIDs first and then validates each board
  as a whole (upstream adds the empty board and then item by item); for a
  file with several errors, the reported error can differ. Messages are
  upstream's.
- The `lock` flag of planes is loaded. Upstream's
  `ProjectLoader::loadBoardPlane()` does not read it, so upstream saves a
  locked plane as unlocked after opening the project; we keep the flag.
  File output differs only for locked planes.
- Removing, mirroring or replacing the library device/footprint of a device
  with connected traces, changing the net of a segment with vias, junctions
  or traces, and adding a device of a schematic-only component fail with an
  error message (`ItemInUse`, `SchematicOnlyComponent`; upstream:
  `LogicError` without message).
- Updating net segment elements in place (`UpdateNetSegmentElements`) may
  change the layer of a connected trace, the layers of a via or the side of
  a standalone pad as long as the result is valid; upstream only allows
  `BI_NetLine::setLayer()` on traces not added to the board (the editor
  removes and re-adds them). Resulting files are the same.
- Air wires are rebuilt on request (`Project::rebuild_air_wires()`, called by
  the loader for each board and by the editor after each command) from the
  nets marked dirty by the mutations, a superset of upstream's
  `scheduleAirWiresRebuild()` calls (e.g. also when only traces change).
  The anchors are added in the order of upstream's registration lists after
  loading a project (component, component signal and pad UUID; net
  segments by UUID). After editing, upstream's lists are in modification
  order, so ties between equally long air wires can be resolved
  differently (display and DRC "missing connection" approvals only), and
  the same holds for hand-written files whose elements are not sorted by
  UUID.
- `BoardNetSegmentSplitter`: new junction UUIDs come from a caller provided
  generator, and the elements of a resulting segment may be listed in
  another order. Files are unaffected (elements are saved sorted by UUID).

## scene (crate librepcb-scene)

Rendering only; no file is affected.

- Schematic texts, pin names and numbers and net/bus labels are drawn with
  the project's stroke font (`newstroke.bene`) instead of the Noto Sans /
  Noto Sans Mono TrueType fonts upstream draws through Qt. The stroke text
  is placed in the box the TrueType text would occupy (Noto Sans descent
  and cap height), with upstream's alignment, auto-rotation, multi-line
  and overline rules; glyph shapes and widths differ.
- Images (schematic and symbol images) are not drawn yet, only their
  borders.
- Pad and via drills are cut out of the copper (filled subpaths nested in
  others become holes, like Qt's odd-even rule); all drills are also
  filled with the background color on a separate layer (the editor look,
  hidden in graphics exports). Standalone board pads are drawn with the
  pad's preview geometries (default mask offsets) until core exposes the
  board pad geometries for them.
- Planes are drawn with the fragments stored in the board's derived data
  (if computed) plus their outline as a hairline.
- Board colors are the dark scheme's primary colors (the editor look); the
  graphics export's color adjustment for white backgrounds is not applied.
  Graphics exports build the scenes with the colors of the export
  settings (`ColorScheme::custom()`).
- Symbols and footprints (`SymbolScene`, `FootprintScene`, upstream
  `SymbolPainter`/`FootprintPainter`) draw their texts raw (e.g.
  `{{NAME}}`) like upstream; footprint texts use the default stroke font
  found at runtime (`LIBREPCB_SHARE`, `../share/librepcb` next to the
  executable, or the upstream checkout the crate was built against); without
  it, no footprint texts are drawn.
- Board graphics export (`BoardPainter`): THT pads and vias are drawn once
  in the pads/vias color if no copper layer is enabled (upstream
  deduplicates identical paths; here only the top copper instance, so vias
  not reaching the top layer are missing). Plane outlines are drawn as
  minimum width lines (upstream: fragments only). Zones and air wires are
  not drawn (like upstream).
- Realistic board rendering (`RealisticBoardPainter`) takes its areas from
  the board scene instead of the 3D scene data (`SceneData3D`, not ported):
  all drills are cut out of the board body (upstream cuts plated drills of
  the viewed side out of the copper only; the result looks the same), and
  flattening uses a 5 µm tolerance like upstream.

## project (ERC, attribute lookup, BOM, JSON export)

- ERC (`project::erc`): where upstream iterates a `QHash`/`QSet` (nets
  attached to a bus) or a registration list (net segments of a net: here
  schematic page order, then segment UUID order; bus segments of a bus:
  schematic UUID order, then segment UUID order; symbol pins of a
  component signal: gate order), items are visited in a deterministic
  order. This only affects the order of the messages and which of several
  equivalent items a message location (highlighting) points to; the
  messages and approvals (`circuit/erc.lp`) are identical. Symbols whose
  pins cannot be computed from the project library are skipped (the loader
  rejects such projects, upstream cannot represent them at all).
- `ProjectAttributeLookup` borrows the project and the objects (upstream:
  `QPointer`s which silently yield empty values after deletion). Built-in
  keys whose library element is missing from the project library
  (`COMPONENT`, `DEVICE`, `PACKAGE`, `FOOTPRINT`) resolve to an empty
  string (upstream cannot represent that state). `PROJECT_DIRPATH` and
  `PROJECT_FILEPATH` are empty for projects not on disk. `CREATED_DATE`,
  `CREATED_TIME`, `DATE` and `TIME` are formatted with chrono in local
  time (`%Y-%m-%d`, `%H:%M:%S`), the same text as Qt's `ISODate`.
- `BomGenerator`: the value cleanup uses the `regex` crate with ASCII `\s`,
  the same set as upstream's `QRegularExpression` without Unicode
  properties; `QString::simplified()` is `split_whitespace()` (see
  General).
- `json_export`: the output is written by a port of `QJsonDocument`'s
  indented format and of Qt 6's `QByteArray::number(d, 'g',
  FloatingPointShortest)` (shortest round-trip digits, exponent form like
  `1e-05` only where shorter). Older Qt versions may format numbers in
  exponent form differently; lengths realistically exported (multiples of
  1 nm between 0.001 mm and 1 m) are formatted identically. Keys are sorted
  like `QJsonObject`.

## workspace

- **Library database** (`libraries/cache_v8.sqlite`): same file name,
  schema, database version and row contents as upstream, so both
  implementations can use the same workspace (not at the same time, the
  data directory is locked). Values are bound like the Qt SQLite driver:
  empty icons/logos and empty `generated_by` are `NULL`, strings upstream
  passes through `nonNull()` are empty strings. URLs (organizations,
  resources, PCB design rules) are stored verbatim instead of normalized by
  `QUrl::toString()`; they are only read for display.
- **Scanner** runs synchronously on a caller provided thread instead of
  an owned `QThread`; progress is a callback. Libraries are scanned in the
  order of their directory names compared case insensitively with
  `str::to_lowercase()` (upstream: `QDir` default sorting), which only
  changes the database row IDs and thus which of two elements with the
  same UUID *and* version is returned as "latest".
- `WorkspaceLibraryDb::Part` is `library::dev::Part`; parts are sorted
  like upstream, with attribute values compared by the natural order of
  `natural_cmp_case_insensitive()` instead of `QCollator` (see library). If
  two attribute values compare equal there, the next attribute decides
  (upstream: the parts compare equal).
- **Workspace settings**: color schemes (`schematic_color_schemes`,
  `board_color_schemes`, `3d_color_schemes`) are kept as raw S-expressions
  and written back unchanged (upstream re-serializes them canonically when
  they are written, i.e. after an edit or a file format upgrade). Keyboard
  shortcuts keep their key sequences as strings without
  `QKeySequence` normalization. The migration of the legacy `themes` entry
  only restores the grid styles; its colors are not converted into user
  color schemes (upstream creates `*_color_schemes` entries from them).
  API endpoint URLs are stored verbatim (upstream: `QUrl`), and an endpoint
  counts as valid if its URL is non-empty (upstream: `QUrl::isValid()`).
- The "workspace requires LibrePCB %2 or later" message fills in both
  placeholders (path and version); upstream passes only the version, so its
  message shows the version as path and a literal `%2`.
- The most recently used workspace path (`QSettings`) is not ported (it
  belongs to the application). `Workspace::open_or_create()` performs the
  steps of the upstream workspace initialization wizard (create, choose and
  copy the data directory) without UI and without downloading the example
  projects.
- Not ported: UI themes and color scheme logic (`UiTheme`, `ColorRole`,
  `BaseColorScheme`, `UserColorScheme`).

### Plane fragments and board exports

- **Plane fragments builder**: creating a `PlaneJob` does not modify the
  board; the processed layers are unscheduled when the result is applied,
  and only if the project was not modified since the job was created
  (upstream takes the scheduled layers when creating the job). Planes may
  therefore be rebuilt more often, the fragments are the same.
- The fragments of a plane are sorted by their first point with a stable
  sort (upstream `std::sort`); the order can only differ for two fragments
  starting at the same point, which Clipper does not produce.
- Cancellation is an `AtomicBool` checked between planes of a layer
  (upstream also checks between the steps of one plane).
- **Missing stroke font**: upstream fails to load a board whose default
  stroke font does not exist in the project (`StrokeFontPool::getFont()`
  throws in the `BI_StrokeText` constructor); here the board loads, and the
  plane rebuild and the exports fail with the same message.
- **Export metadata**: the application version and creation date written
  into Gerber, Excellon, pick&place and IPC-D-356A files are passed in by
  the caller (`ExportInfo`), see "export".
- **Output paths** are resolved relative to the project directory like
  upstream; a project without a directory on disk (in-memory file system)
  cannot export to relative paths (error instead of a path relative to an
  empty directory).

- **Interactive HTML BOM generator** (`BoardInteractiveHtmlBomGenerator`):
  the generation date is a `Timestamp` (the date of the `ExportInfo`,
  written as `yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss` in the time zone of the value). The
  designator prefix for the component order strips trailing
  `char::is_numeric` characters (upstream: `QChar::isDigit()`, i.e.
  only decimal digits; differs for other numeric characters like `²`).
  BOM rows are grouped by their field values in Rust `String` order
  (upstream: `QStringList` in UTF-16 order) and sorted with a stable sort
  (upstream: `std::sort`); the resulting order only differs for rows whose
  first designators compare equal (e.g. `r1` and `R1`).
  `Board::calculateBoundingRect()` is ported as a private helper of the
  generator.

### Specctra DSN export

- The DSN output is byte-identical to upstream (upstream unit test
  expectation), including upstream's quirks that define the bytes: blind
  and buried via padstack IDs contain a literal `%2` (nested
  `QString::arg()`), vertical oblong pads are exported as a zero-length
  path.
- The host CAD name and version in the `parser` node are parameters
  (default "LibrePCB" and the crate version; upstream: the application
  name and version).
- The pins of a net are ordered by (component UUID, signal UUID, pad UUID)
  and (net segment UUID, pad UUID); upstream iterates its registration
  lists, which is the same order for a freshly opened project but can
  differ after editing (only the order of the `pins` list changes).

## project/board/drc

- **Iteration order**: the input data keeps net segments, devices, pads,
  vias and junctions in `BTreeMap`s (UUID order) and layers in `BTreeSet`s;
  upstream iterates `QHash`es/`QSet`s. Approvals are identical (upstream
  sorts the objects of an approval canonically), but the order of the two
  objects in the text of a copper clearance message (`'GND' pad ↔ 'VCC'
  pad`) and the order of the messages may differ. Merging of copper
  clearance violations per object pair is order independent.
- **Keepout zones**: upstream tests the intersection with
  `QPainterPath::intersects()` against the union (`|=`, `QPathClipper`) of
  the object areas; here each area is tested with the ported Qt predicate
  (`PainterPathPx::intersects()`) and the object intersects if any area
  does. Via areas are circles drawn with arcs (same Bézier quarter curves)
  instead of `QPainterPath::addEllipse()`. Results only differ for objects
  touching a zone within Qt's curve sampling tolerance.
- **Device names** in "Device in courtyard"/"Device overlap" messages are
  ordered by `str` ordering instead of `QString` (UTF-16) ordering; only
  names with characters outside the BMP can be affected.
- **Plane fragments**: like upstream, a full check rebuilds all planes;
  if the plane job cannot be created (e.g. missing stroke font, see
  "Plane fragments and board exports"), `Project::run_drc()` fails with
  that error.
- **Errors**: checks that fail (e.g. a non-positive calculated diameter)
  report the error in `DrcResult::errors` like upstream, with the Rust error
  message. A panic of a check thread is reported as error as well.
- **Approval cleanup** (`Board::updateDrcMessageApprovals()`):
  `Project::drc_approvals_update()` returns a `SetDrcApprovals` mutation
  instead of modifying the board; the set of approvals seen during the
  session is derived data of the board. `ProjectEditor::update_drc_approvals()`
  applies it without undo step and marks the project as manually modified,
  like upstream's board editor. `librepcb-cli` does not clean up approvals
  (like upstream).
- `DrcMsgInvalidPadConnection` keeps upstream's untranslated `'%2'` in its
  message (upstream substitutes only the first placeholder).

## editor (crate librepcb-editor)

- **Undo stack**: every change is recorded in a group (upstream `execCmd()`
  of a single command is a group with one operation). The redo history is
  discarded when a group is *committed*; upstream discards it when a group
  is started, so an aborted group also loses the redo history there. If
  undoing or redoing fails (a violated model invariant), the applied steps
  are rolled back and the history is cleared; upstream rethrows and leaves
  the stack as it is. `state_id()` replaces `getUniqueStateId()`/the
  `stateModified` signal.
- **Combining net segments** (`CmdCombineSchematicNetSegments`,
  `CmdCombineBoardNetSegments`, used when a wire or trace connects two
  segments) moves the elements with their UUIDs; upstream re-creates
  junctions, pads, vias and labels with new random UUIDs. Likewise the
  segments re-added after removing items keep the UUIDs of their elements
  (upstream: new junction and label UUIDs). Files differ only in these
  (random) UUIDs.
- **Forced net names** of component signals (e.g. `{{VALUE}}` of supply
  symbols) are applied like upstream by the wiring commands and to the
  segments re-added after removals, but only if the substituted name is a
  valid net name (upstream collects the raw strings, and the wiring tool
  shows a message box for invalid ones; we log a warning). An explicit
  `net` parameter of a wiring command takes precedence over a forced name.
- **Removing traces as a side effect** (disconnecting component signals,
  replacing devices, changing the net of a schematic segment) does not
  remove unused project library elements; upstream's nested
  `CmdRemoveBoardItems` does. The explicit `RemoveBoardItems` and all
  schematic removals do, like upstream.
- **`AddBoard`** with `copy_settings_from` copies only the board settings;
  upstream `Board::copyFrom()` also copies all items.
- **Adding a via** connects it to the traces and junctions of its net at
  its position like upstream's add-via tool (hit test: the trace width
  resp. the widest trace at a junction instead of the graphics items'
  shapes), but builds the combined segment in one step: split traces are
  replaced by two traces to the via (upstream first adds a split junction,
  then replaces it), the element UUIDs of the combined segments are kept.
- **Autorouter** (`Autoroute`): no upstream counterpart (upstream only
  exports Specctra DSN); see the `commands::autoroute` module docs.
- **`create_project()`** copies the stroke fonts from a given directory
  (upstream: the application resources directory), because the core's
  `Project::create()` does not know the application resources yet.
- Interactive steps are replaced by parameters: no snapping to the grid or
  to items, gates of a multi-gate component are placed with a fixed offset
  unless placed individually, and the default device of `AddDevice` is the
  first device of the component's assembly options.

### Schematic editor FSM (`fsm::schematic`)

- **Undo steps** are upstream's: a drag is one group, followed by a
  separate group simplifying the modified net and bus segments (also
  after removing items); a paste and the one-shot operations (rotate,
  mirror, move by keys, snap) do not simplify, like upstream. Drawing a
  wire or bus is one group per clicked segment plus a simplification group
  when finishing.
- **Live previews** are mutations in the open undo group, replaced on
  every pointer move; upstream modifies the objects without undo and
  records the command at the end. While a tool keeps a group open, other
  commands (e.g. from the embedded MCP server) join that group.
- **Clipboard:** the format is upstream's (`schematic.lp` in a ZIP under
  `application/x-librepcb-clipboard.schematic; version=<app version>`).
  When pasting, net lines at bus junctions of a bus segment which was
  split while copying are attached to the right part (upstream keeps only
  the junctions of the last part). Symbol clipboard data (from the symbol
  editor) pastes its polygons, texts and images like upstream.
- **Hit testing:** net and bus junctions are tested on the model with
  upstream's 1.2 mm grab square; items of equal priority keep the item
  order (upstream: `QMultiMap` insertion order).
- **Images:** the file name of an added image is derived from the file
  name without asking the user (upstream: an input dialog), the image
  chooser is requested from the application.
- **Find:** component candidates are the symbol names (with gate suffix)
  resolved through the symbols of the page, so symbols of multi-gate
  components are found too (upstream looks them up as component names).
- **Cross-probing** is an output of the FSM (`cross_probe()`); the
  application highlights the objects in the other editors.

### Board editor FSM (`fsm::board`)

- **Live previews** are mutations in the open undo group, replaced on
  every change (dragging, trace positioning, placing vias, pads, devices,
  texts and holes, drawing polygons, planes and zones); upstream modifies
  the objects without undo and records the edit commands at the end. The
  resulting undo steps are upstream's ("Drag Board Elements", one "Draw
  Board Trace" group per clicked segment, one "Draw board polygon/plane/
  zone" group per vertex, ...). Air wires are rebuilt during previews.
- **Draw trace:** net segments are combined keeping the element UUIDs
  (upstream creates new segments); a pad without traces is attached to the
  current segment directly (upstream first creates a segment for it).
- **Add pad:** changing the net re-creates the preview segment with the
  new net (upstream removes, edits and re-adds it).
- **Hit testing:** grab areas are the scene items of `librepcb-scene`
  (device grab area: its footprint graphics); junctions are tested on the
  model with a circle of the widest trace at them (upstream
  `BGI_NetPoint`). Items of equal priority are ordered by item reference
  (upstream: `QMultiMap` insertion order).
- **Selection:** held by the FSM; selecting a device selects its texts
  (like upstream). The rubber band selects junctions whose position is in
  the rectangle (upstream: whose circle touches it).
- **Clipboard:** upstream's format (`board.lp` plus `dev/`, `pkg/` in a
  ZIP under `application/x-librepcb-clipboard.board; version=<app
  version>`). Footprint clipboard data (from the package editor) pastes
  its polygons, stroke texts and holes like upstream. Like upstream, a
  pasted net whose name does not exist becomes a new net with an automatic
  name.
- **Change device:** the devices offered in the context menu come from the
  editor's library element source (upstream: the workspace library
  database).
- **Cross-probing** is an output of the FSM (`cross_probe()`,
  `highlighted_nets()`); the application highlights the objects in the
  other editors.
- Not ported: plane visibility from the context menu (a view setting of
  the application) and aborting blocking tools of other editors (the
  application must abort them).

### DXF reader (`import::dxf_reader`)

- Based on the `dxf` crate instead of dxflib: an empty file is read as a
  drawing without entities like upstream, but other files the crate
  rejects are reported as errors even where dxflib silently reads
  nothing.

### Library element editors (`library_editor`, `fsm::library`)

- **Undo stack:** a group stores snapshots of the element content before
  and after it (upstream: undo command objects). The grid interval and
  message approvals are not part of the snapshots; changing them marks the
  element as modified without undo, like upstream. A group without changes
  is dropped.
- **Auxiliary files:** image files of removed symbol images and STEP files
  of removed 3D models are deleted when saving (upstream: immediately, by
  `CmdImageRemove` / `CmdPackageModelRemove`, restored on undo). Writing a
  STEP file (`AddPackageModel`, `EditPackageModel`) is not undone; files
  written since the last save which are unreferenced at the next save are
  deleted.
- **Live previews** modify the element inside the open undo group (upstream:
  edit commands with `immediate = true`); the undo steps are upstream's.
- **Hit testing:** the FSMs query a view (`LibraryView`); the model based
  `ModelHitTester` approximates texts by rectangles (0.7 × height per
  character) and pins by their line; `SymbolScene`/`FootprintScene` map
  their items to objects (zones are not drawn by `FootprintScene`, like the
  upstream graphics export).
- **Dialogs** (pin/pad/polygon properties, import pins, courtyard excess,
  fix parameters) are requests to the application; check fixes take their
  answers as `FixParams`.
- Not ported: adding images and resizing them, DXF import, "paste
  geometry" into pads; the clipboard data has no pixmap.

## project (output job runner)

- **Graphics jobs** need a `GraphicsExporter` set by the caller
  (`set_graphics_exporter()`, the CLI uses the scene crate's
  `ProjectGraphicsExporter`) since the painters live in the scene crate;
  without one they fail like unsupported job types. `build_pages()` ports
  `buildPages()`; for board contents with "no board" (a project without
  boards and the default board set), no page is created (upstream would
  dereference a null board).
- **3D (STEP) jobs** behave like upstream built without OpenCascade (the
  STEP export is not ported): the planes are rebuilt, the output file is
  announced (`AboutToWriteFile`), then the job fails with "Attempted to
  work with STEP file, but LibrePCB was compiled without OpenCascade."
  Unknown job types fail with the upstream message.
- The Qt signals (`jobStarted`, `aboutToWriteFile`, `aboutToRemoveFile`,
  `warning`) are one observer callback (`OutputJobEvent`).
- The application version and creation date written into the files are
  passed in (`ExportInfo`), one date for the whole run (upstream takes the
  current time for each file).
- Archive jobs collect their input files in an in-memory transactional
  file system; upstream opens a writable one in a random temporary
  directory, which is left behind. The archive content is the same (of
  several input files with the same name, the first written one wins like
  upstream's `QMultiHash` iteration), but the ZIP entries are sorted (see
  TransactionalFileSystem). The same applies to `*.lppz` output jobs.
- A project without a directory on disk cannot run output jobs (the
  output directory is relative to it).

## import (crate librepcb-import)

- EAGLE XML (parseagle): numbers are parsed with `str::parse` after
  trimming instead of `QString::toDouble()`/`toInt()`, and XML is read
  with `roxmltree` (DTDs allowed) instead of `QDomDocument`; realistic
  files are read the same, exotic number spellings Qt accepts may be
  rejected.
- HTML descriptions (EAGLE) are converted to plain text by a small
  converter (`html::html_to_plain_text`: block elements become line
  breaks, entities are decoded) instead of `QTextDocument::toPlainText()`;
  whitespace can differ in unusual markup.
- Grab areas of EAGLE symbols: the union of the filled outlines is
  computed with Clipper (only overlapping shapes are united) instead of
  `QPainterPath::united()`, and "is the text inside the grab area" uses the
  same union; the imported files of the upstream test data are identical.
- KiCad footprints: lines are grouped into polygons per (layer, width) in
  a deterministic order (layer order, then width) instead of upstream's
  `QMap` order keyed by `Layer` pointers, so the order of polygons in
  `package.lp` can differ from upstream (upstream's own order is not
  stable either).
- Directory scans list entries sorted by Rust string ordering instead of
  `QDir::Name` ordering (UTF-16 based; differs only for exotic names).
- KiCad datasheet URLs are taken as written instead of being normalized
  by `QUrl` (and not checked with `QUrl::isValid()`).
- `MessageLogger` child loggers prefix messages with `"[group] "` and
  forward them synchronously (no Qt signals); scan, parse and import run
  on the caller's thread and report through `Progress` (percent, status,
  cancellation) instead of `QThread`/`QFuture` and signals.
- The KiCad import's lookup of already imported elements
  (`ImportedElementLookup`, implemented for `LibraryDb`) does not wait
  for a running workspace library scan like upstream; the caller
  rescans first if needed.
- EAGLE project import: `Project::create()` of the core does not copy the
  stroke fonts; callers (MCP `project_create`, tests) write
  `resources/fontobene` themselves before creating the project.
- `EagleLibraryImport` enables the "EAGLE Import" categories by default
  (upstream's class has none, the wizard enables them);
  `KiCadLibraryImport` keeps upstream's class default (disabled). The
  MCP tool `library_import` uses the wizards' defaults (name prefix off,
  categories on) for both.

## CLI (crate librepcb-cli)

The console output (messages, help texts, exit codes) is identical to
upstream `librepcb-cli` 2.1.1 except for:

- **Graphics exports** (`open-project --export-schematics`, `open-symbol
  --export`, `open-package --export`, graphics output jobs) print the same
  lines as upstream, but the files differ (see export). The help texts
  list `pdf, svg, bmp, jpeg, jpg, png` as supported extensions (upstream:
  PDF, SVG and all image formats of the Qt installation).
- **STEP models**: behaves like an upstream build without OpenCascade:
  `open-step` and `open-library --minify-step` fail with
  "Attempted to work with STEP file, but LibrePCB was compiled without
  OpenCascade." (the upstream CLI tests skip these cases). 3D output jobs
  print their output file name and fail with the same message, so the
  upstream `--run-jobs` tests with a STEP job are skipped as well.
- **`--version`** prints `Implementation librepcb-rs (Rust, no Qt)`
  instead of the Qt version line, `OpenCascade N/A`, and the Git revision
  `unknown`; the application version is the crate version (also written
  into exported files as generating software).
- **`--verbose`** log messages use the `env_logger` format and the
  messages of the Rust port (upstream: Qt's message handler format).
- **Parser errors**: the command line is parsed with `clap`; the error
  texts of `QCommandLineParser` are reproduced for unknown options
  (all of them, like `Unknown options: a, b, c.`), missing and unexpected
  values. The parser strings of Qt (`Usage: {0}`, `Options:`,
  `Arguments:`, the error texts) are not in LibrePCB's translation
  catalogs, so they are always English (upstream: Qt's catalogs).

- **Specctra session import** (`ImportSpecctraSession`, upstream
  `CmdBoardSpecctraImport`): messages are returned (and logged with the
  `log` crate) instead of a `MessageLogger`; net segments without net are
  matched by their exported dummy net name (`~anonymous~<uuid>`), so each
  keeps its own pads (upstream adds the pads of all segments without net to
  every such net); only footprint pads of the imported board are anchors
  (upstream also considers pads of the same component on other boards);
  old traces are matched regardless of their direction; zero-length wire
  segments are skipped. Via padstack names mangled by FreeRouting 2.x
  (fractional digits dropped, e.g. `via-0:auto-0:auto-tht`) are mapped back
  to the exported names, so drill, size and exposure are kept (upstream
  falls back to automatic values). Additionally, a strict mode validates
  the session against the export (unchanged project revision and
  placement, known nets and padstacks) before modifying the board.
- **FreeRouting** (`FreeroutingRouter`, no upstream counterpart: upstream
  only exports/imports files): the DSN passed to FreeRouting uses the
  resolution 1/100000 mm instead of the export's 1/1000000 mm, because
  FreeRouting 2.4.1 reports bogus clearance violations and leaves
  connections unrouted with the finer resolution.

## app (crate librepcb-app)

- **Number formatting in the UI** (`Backend.format-length` etc.) uses `.`
  as decimal separator and no group separators instead of `QLocale`; input
  parsing uses the math parser with `.` (upstream accepts the locale's
  decimal separator too).
- **Workspace selection:** no workspace wizard. The workspace comes from
  `--workspace`, `LIBREPCB_WORKSPACE`, upstream's client settings
  (`workspaces/most_recently_used` in `~/.config/LibrePCB/LibrePCB.conf`,
  read only, Linux) or `~/LibrePCB-Workspace`, which is created without
  asking.
- **Locked projects** open read-only with a notification (upstream asks
  whether to override the lock); `*.lppz` archives cannot be opened yet.
- **Grid interval and unit** changed in a tab modify the schematic or the
  board settings like upstream (so the editor tools snap to the shown
  grid), but as an undoable step ("Change Grid Properties"); upstream
  changes them without undo command.
- **Layers panel** lists the board layers used by the board in
  `Layer::all()` order, and the layer presets (top, bottom, ...) are
  simplified; the visibility is not stored in the board user settings yet.
- **Scene editing (schematic and board tabs):** the editor FSMs of
  `librepcb-editor` get the Slint pointer/key events; double clicks are
  detected like upstream (500 ms) but allow 2 px of movement between the
  presses (upstream: same scene position). Overlays (selection rectangle,
  ruler, scene cursor, gray-out) are canvas items; the ruler has no tick
  labels. Hovered items are not highlighted. Cross-probing highlights the
  selected symbols/devices and the nets of selected wires, traces and
  vias (and the nets of the trace being drawn) in the other tabs of the
  project with the selection color (upstream: a separate highlight
  state, also driven by hovering). A tool which keeps an undo group open
  is aborted when another tab of the project is used, becomes current or
  is closed, and before undo, redo and save.
- **Context menus** of the scenes are a Slint popup built from the FSM's
  entries (upstream: `QMenu`); resource (datasheet) entries are missing.
- **Dialogs (M3b):** upstream's Qt Widgets dialogs are Slint overlays of
  the main window (one at a time; the application keeps running). Most
  are generic *form dialogs* (`ui/dialogs/formdialog.slint`,
  `src/dialogs/`) built from upstream's widgets with the labels of the
  upstream `.ui` files; the layout differs (one column of labeled fields,
  pages as tabs, radio buttons drawn as check boxes). Each dialog applies
  its changes as one undo group ("OK"/"Apply"); "Cancel" discards them.
  Details per dialog are in the module docs of `src/dialogs/*.rs`; the
  main differences:
  - *Symbol properties:* the name swap question is shown in the dialog
    ("click OK again to swap"); assembly options can be removed and their
    assembly variants edited, not added; library names are plain text.
  - *Device properties:* the device and footprint are chosen from combo
    boxes (upstream: context menu only).
  - *Pad properties:* holes and custom pad outlines are not editable.
  - *Path vertices* (polygons, zones, ...) are edited in place; vertices
    cannot be added or removed in the dialogs.
  - *Board setup:* DRC presets of organizations cannot be loaded yet
    (only "Reset to Default Settings" and "Remove Link to Imported
    Settings"); the inner layer count is a combo box.
  - *Project setup:* locales are shown and added by their code (e.g.
    `de_CH`) instead of the language name; net classes are renamed below
    the list; assembly variants are applied with the other settings
    (upstream: immediately) and cannot be reordered.
  - *Add component:* the symbol preview shows the first gate only; no live
    part information and no context menu; choosing a part selects its
    device. "Add more" reopens the dialog whenever the placement ends with
    the select tool (upstream: after Escape).
  - *Graphics export:* edits a graphics output job (like the output jobs
    dialog) and writes into the output directory (`output/<version>/`,
    path with `{{PROJECT}}` etc.) instead of asking with a file dialog;
    format by file extension. No page preview, no printing, no copy to
    clipboard, all schematic pages; colors can be enabled/disabled but not
    changed, and are named by their color role where no layer exists.
  - *Output jobs:* jobs are added from a combo box (no organization
    presets, no "Import Old Settings"); running reports in notifications
    instead of a log panel; unknown files in the output directory are not
    listed or removed; the interactive HTML BOM job's check box and
    component order lists are not editable.
  - *BOM review:* no live part information (availability, prices); the
    custom attributes are stored (undoable) when closing with "OK"
    (upstream: while typing, without undo).
  - *Pick&place generator:* generates through an output job in a worker
    thread with paths relative to `output/<version>/` (upstream:
    `./output/{{VERSION}}/...` relative to the project), closes the dialog;
    no "Browse Output Directory".
  - *Move/align:* the new positions are applied when accepting (upstream:
    live while editing); used by the package editor.
  - *Not ported yet:* the workspace settings, lock handler and project wizard dialogs (M3c).
- **Clipboard:** copy/paste uses the system clipboard with upstream's MIME
  types through `clipboard-rs` (X11, Wayland, macOS, Windows). Exchange
  with upstream LibrePCB (same version) works on X11/Wayland; on Windows
  and macOS Qt stores custom MIME types under its own format names, which
  are not reproduced. Without a system clipboard (no display, or
  `LIBREPCB_NO_SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD` set), an in-app clipboard is used.
- **M3d tools in the tabs:** buses (the tool button's menu of existing
  buses starts the tool with the chosen bus), images, the standalone pad
  tools and DXF import work like upstream, with these differences:
  - *Bus member menu:* the "Add New Bus Member" / nets / "Cancel" menu is
    the scene's Slint popup; closing it by clicking into the scene counts
    as "Cancel" (upstream's `QMenu::exec()` is modal).
  - *Images:* PNG, JPEG and SVG files only (upstream converts other
    formats supported by Qt's image readers to PNG); the image file name
    is not asked for (the file's base name is used).
  - *DXF import dialog:* a form dialog; its choices are remembered while
    the application runs (upstream: in the client settings); the scale
    factor is a text field.
  - *Find:* the suggestions have no icons; the zoom rectangle is the
    bounding box of the highlighted scene items (upstream: graphics items
    of the found objects), with upstream's margin.
  - *Plane visibility* (plane context menu "Visible") is a model setting
    applied without undo step, like upstream not saved.
  - *Cross-probing* also highlights the pins or pads of the component
    signals the other tab reports (`fsmCrossProbe()`) and buses.
- **Not available yet in the tabs:** the unplaced components panel and
  plane rebuilds (board).
- **Library management (M4a):**
  - *Libraries panel:* no automatic update check or installation timer;
    the online list is fetched when the panel is shown or "check for
    updates" is clicked. The download progress of a library is "running"
    or "done" only (the installer of `librepcb-network` downloads the
    ZIP and falls back to cloning the repository with git).
  - *Library tab:* moving/copying elements into other libraries is not
    ported; the checks run synchronously after each change. Closing a
    library tab discards its unsaved changes without asking.
  - *Undo stacks:* the library tab and every element tab have their own
    undo stack (upstream shares one per library editor).
  - *No file system watcher:* the "files modified" banner of the tabs is
    never shown; elements changed on disk are not reloaded.
- **Library element editors (M4b):**
  - *Symbol and package editors:* images and DXF import are not
    available in the symbol and package editors, nor graphics export,
    printing and the background image. There is no 3D view in the
    package editor: the 3D models can be added (the STEP file is stored
    as-is, not minified and not validated since there is no
    OpenCascade), renamed, replaced, reordered, removed and assigned to
    footprints with their transform, but not shown. Keepout zones are
    drawn filled in the zone color with a hairline outline.
  - *Wizard of new elements:* the pages and the saving per page follow
    upstream; for components, the variants page is still part of the
    wizard (adding gates creates the signals) like upstream. The checks
    run only after the wizard, like upstream. New elements are named
    like upstream (`"New Symbol"`, ...; not translated) and new packages
    and components get a `"default"` footprint or symbol variant.
  - *Interface protection:* elements opened as new or duplicated keep
    being writable while their tab is open (upstream `mIsNewElement`);
    others become read-only after an interface-breaking change until
    "unlock" (upstream: same).
  - *Symbol previews* in the component and device tabs are images
    rendered with `librepcb-scene`: the pins are labeled with the
    connected signal names (component tab) but not with the pad numbers
    (device tab); texts are shown raw (`{{NAME}}`). The device previews
    are not zoomable and have no measure tool.
  - *Chooser dialogs:* symbols, components and packages are chosen from
    one searchable list with the description of the selected element
    (upstream: a category tree, the list and a graphical preview).
  - *Device pinout:* "auto-connect" and "load from file" keep the
    existing connections (upstream asks whether to reset them first).
  - *Organizations:* the PCB design rules and the output jobs of an
    organization cannot be edited yet (upstream opens the board setup
    and output jobs dialogs on a temporary project); design rules can be
    added (with default settings), renamed, copied and removed.
  - *Categories and organizations* use a snapshot undo stack over the
    element's metadata and content (like the other element editors).
  - *Opening elements from projects* (upstream: the project library
    tab) is not available since the project library tab is not ported.
  - *Slint 1.18.1 workaround:* the footprint tags panel of the package
    tab has a fixed border radius for its "new tag" field (see
    `ui/PROVENANCE.md`, item 9).
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** `Backend.is-shortcut` compares with the default
  shortcut of the `.slint` command set only (no user overrides, no
  alternative shortcuts).
- **Zooming** is not animated.
- **Embedded MCP server** (no upstream counterpart): a status bar button
  (next to the notifications button) and `--mcp[=ADDR]` start LibrePCB's
  MCP server inside the application (`127.0.0.1:8766`). The agent edits the
  project of the active tab through the same undo stack; workspace
  switches by the agent are refused.
- **Rule checks:** approving or unapproving an ERC/DRC message is an
  undoable command (`SetErcApproval`/`SetDrcApproval` mutations; upstream
  modifies the project outside the undo stack). Approvals of messages
  which disappeared are not cleaned up yet by the tabs (upstream removes
  them after a check run; the editor provides
  `ProjectEditor::update_erc_approvals()`/`update_drc_approvals()`, used
  by the MCP server). Selecting a message
  zooms to its location, but no location marker is drawn; automatic fixes
  are not available yet.
- **DRC** runs in a worker thread which locks the project only to rebuild
  the planes and air wires and to extract the check data.
- **Outputs from the menus:** PDF and image export, pick&place, the BOM
  review and "Output Jobs" open their dialogs (see above);
  Gerber/Excellon, IPC-D-356A netlist and `*.lppz` export run without
  dialog with default settings into `<project>/output/<version>/` and
  report the files in a notification. Printing and Specctra export are
  not available yet.
