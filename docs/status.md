# Status and handoff

State of the port as of 2026-09-27, for continuing the work in a new
session (for example a cloud session). Read `AGENTS.md` first; this file
covers where things stand and how the work has been organized.

## Where we are

Milestone M1 (headless `librepcb-cli`, see `roadmap.md`) is in progress.
`master` builds cleanly and 915 tests pass (about 85k lines of Rust).

Done, in `crates/librepcb-core` unless noted:

- **Base:** types, the S-expression format, the serialization traits, and utils.
  Upstream Qt semantics are dropped, with the divergences listed in `COMPAT.md`.
- **Geometry, stroke fonts, polygon clipping:** `crates/clipper` is a
  faithful port of Clipper 1, verified differentially against the C++
  library.
- **Attributes, air wires** (spade + petgraph), the math parser (evalexpr),
  and SQLite.
- **File I/O** (transactional file system, directory locks, ZIP, CSV) and
  system info; `crates/librepcb-network` (tokio + reqwest).
- **Libraries:** all element types and their checks. Check messages and
  approvals are identical to upstream `librepcb-cli --check`; the package
  check ports Qt's painter path predicates on purpose, because approvals
  are stored in files.
- **Export generators:** Gerber, Excellon, IPC-D-356A, BOM and pick & place.
- **File format migrations** v0.1 → v1 → v2. Migrated projects and
  libraries match `librepcb-cli` byte for byte.
- **Output jobs** (`job`): all job types as plain data (`OutputJob` +
  `OutputJobKind` enum), `jobs.lp` and organization job templates typed,
  presets and the editor's default job set, `GraphicsExportSettings`
  (plain data). The job runner is not ported yet.
- **Project model** (`project/`), designed in `project-model-design.md`:
  circuit, schematics and boards with mutations, inverses, the reverse
  index, the change journal and serde. All test projects round-trip byte
  for byte.
- **`crates/librepcb-canvas`:** a retained 2D scene rendered with vello_cpu,
  with hit testing and a Slint adapter.
- **`crates/librepcb-i18n`, `tools/ts2po`, `lang/`:** translations from the
  upstream catalogs, with Slint bundled translations.

## Next steps

1. **Wave 3c** (can run in parallel, three agents):
   - board export data and the plane fragments builder, plus the Gerber,
     Excellon, pick & place and D356 glue that drives the existing
     generators;
   - DRC (the largest remaining core piece, about 8k lines of C++);
   - ERC, the BOM generator, project attribute lookup, and the JSON export
     of the project.
2. **Wave 4:** the output job runner (on top of the ported `job` data
   model) and the CLI. Acceptance:
   upstream `tests/cli` (pytest, run with `uv`) passing against our CLI,
   plus output diffs against the official `librepcb-cli`.
3. **Then M1.5** (MCP, library manager, Specctra) per `roadmap.md` and the
   decisions in `mcp-research-konnect.md`.

Deliberately deferred: the schematic/board painters (M2), Specctra
(M1.5), the interactive HTML BOM, 3D/STEP, and the Eagle/KiCad importers
(M5).

## How the work is organized

- Work goes in **waves** of parallel agents, each in its own git worktree
  (`../librepcb-rs.w<N>-<name>`, branch `wave<N>/<name>`) with a clearly
  separated file ownership. The coordinating session reviews each branch
  (fmt, clippy, tests, no hardcoded paths), merges it into `master` and
  pushes.
- Related small tasks are batched per agent (about 5–10 agents per wave),
  rather than one agent per tiny task.
- Architecture and design work (design documents) runs on the strongest
  available model, and the design is reviewed with the user before
  implementation starts.
- Acceptance is always mechanical where possible: upstream unit test
  vectors, byte-identical round trips over upstream `tests/data`, and diffs
  against the official `librepcb-cli`.
- Each intentional divergence from upstream goes into `COMPAT.md`.

## Environment

Run `scripts/cloud-setup.sh` on a fresh machine. It sets up the pinned
upstream checkout next to the repository and the official `librepcb-cli`
behind Xvfb; after that, `cargo test --workspace` runs everything,
including the upstream comparisons.

## Open items to remember

- Adding and removing project library elements are `Project` methods, not
  `Mutation`s. They must become undoable when the command bus is designed
  (M1.5), because agents will add parts through MCP.
- Upstream bugs found along the way, which could be reported upstream:
  Qt/Transifex plural form order mismatches in several languages, `"1e-3"`
  rejected as a length, and a v0.1 circular board outline that cannot be
  migrated.
