# librepcb-rs

A work-in-progress rewrite of [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org) — the free EDA
suite for schematics and PCBs — in Rust, with a [Slint](https://slint.dev) UI
and no Qt.

The goals:

- **File-compatible with upstream LibrePCB.** Everything upstream writes can be
  read, and everything this project writes can be read by upstream. Files are
  written byte-identically to upstream's canonical format.
- **Idiomatic Rust**, not a line-by-line transliteration: plain data models,
  no Qt emulation, existing crates wherever they fit.
- **Designing boards with AI agents.** An MCP server built on the same model
  as the editor, so agents can query and edit projects, run ERC/DRC and
  export manufacturing data, with every change validated and undoable.

This is an unofficial project and is not affiliated with the LibrePCB
project. All credit for the design, the file format and the original code
goes to the [LibrePCB developers](https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB).

## Built with AI agents

Most of the code in this repository was written by AI coding agents (Claude
Code) under human direction, porting the upstream C++ code module by module.
Treat it accordingly. What keeps it honest is a strict verification setup:

- the upstream unit tests are ported with their original test vectors;
- round-trip tests load every file in upstream's test data and require
  byte-identical output;
- where possible, results are compared directly against the upstream
  `librepcb-cli` (library checks, file format migrations, export generators).

Every intentional behavior difference from upstream is listed in
[COMPAT.md](COMPAT.md).

## Status

Early. There is no application or CLI yet; the work so far is the core
library that everything else builds on.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Base types, S-expression file format | done |
| Geometry, stroke fonts, polygon clipping (Clipper 1 port) | done |
| Attributes, air wires, math expressions | done |
| File I/O (transactional file system, directory locks, ZIP), networking | done |
| Libraries: symbols, packages, components, devices, categories, organizations, and their checks | done, check output identical to upstream |
| Gerber, Excellon, IPC-D-356A, BOM, pick & place generators | done |
| File format migrations (v0.1 → v1 → v2) | done |
| Project model: circuit, schematics, boards (with undoable mutations and a change journal) | done |
| Plane fragments, DRC, ERC, output jobs, CLI | next |
| MCP server, library manager, Specctra export for autorouting | planned |
| Slint viewer and editor | planned (a rendering canvas already exists) |

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the milestones and
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md) for the current state and next steps.

## Building and testing

You need a recent stable Rust toolchain (edition 2024).

Many tests use upstream LibrePCB's test data, and some compare against the
upstream command line tool. `scripts/cloud-setup.sh` sets both up on a fresh
machine (Debian/Ubuntu packages, Rust if missing, the pinned upstream checkout
next to this repository, and the official `librepcb-cli` release run through
Xvfb):

```sh
scripts/cloud-setup.sh
```

Or check out upstream manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB.git ../LibrePCB
git -C ../LibrePCB submodule update --init tests/data share/librepcb/fontobene i18n libs/fontobene-qt
```

The location is set by `LIBREPCB_UPSTREAM_DIR` in `.cargo/config.toml`
(default `../LibrePCB`) and can be overridden from the environment:

```sh
LIBREPCB_UPSTREAM_DIR=/path/to/LibrePCB cargo test
```

Then:

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The file format migration test compares against the upstream command line
tool (same file format version), taken from `LIBREPCB_CLI` or `librepcb-cli`
on the `PATH`; without it, that comparison is skipped.

To see the canvas demo:

```sh
cargo run --release -p librepcb-canvas --features slint --example canvas_demo
```
