# librepcb-rs

A work-in-progress rewrite of [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org) — the free EDA
suite for schematics and PCBs — in Rust, with a [Slint](https://slint.dev) UI
and no Qt.

The goals:

- **File-compatible with upstream LibrePCB.** Everything upstream writes can be
  read, and everything this project writes can be read by upstream. Files are
  written byte-identically to upstream's canonical format.
- **Idiomatic Rust**, not a line-by-line transliteration: plain data models,
  no Qt emulation, existing crates wherever they fit.
- **Designing boards with AI agents.** An MCP server built on the same model
  as the editor, so agents can query and edit projects, run ERC/DRC and
  export manufacturing data, with every change validated and undoable.

This is an unofficial project and is not affiliated with the LibrePCB
project. All credit for the design, the file format and the original code
goes to the [LibrePCB developers](https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB).

## Built with AI agents

Most of the code in this repository was written by AI coding agents (Claude
Code) under human direction, porting the upstream C++ code module by module.
Treat it accordingly. What keeps it honest is a strict verification setup:

- the upstream unit tests are ported with their original test vectors;
- round-trip tests load every file in upstream's test data and require
  byte-identical output;
- where possible, results are compared directly against the upstream
  `librepcb-cli` (library checks, file format migrations, export generators).

Every intentional behavior difference from upstream is listed in
[COMPAT.md](COMPAT.md).

## Status

The headless core, a command line tool and an MCP server work; the Slint
application is next.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Base types, S-expression file format, geometry, stroke fonts, Clipper 1 port | done |
| Libraries (symbols, packages, components, devices, ...) and their checks | done, check output identical to upstream |
| File format migrations (v0.1 → v1 → v2) | done, byte-identical to upstream |
| Project model: circuit, schematics, boards (undoable mutations, change journal) | done |
| ERC, DRC | done, messages identical to upstream on all test projects |
| Plane fragments, Gerber/Excellon, pick & place, IPC-D-356A, BOM, JSON exports | done, byte-identical to upstream |
| Graphics export (PDF/SVG/PNG), output jobs | done (graphics not byte-identical to Qt) |
| `librepcb-cli` | done: upstream `tests/cli` passes except `--version` and the interactive HTML BOM |
| Workspace, library index, library download | done |
| Editing commands with undo, autorouting (built-in router, Freerouting via Specctra DSN/SES) | done |
| MCP server | working: agents design schematics and boards end to end |
| Slint viewer and editor | planned (canvas and scene rendering exist) |

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the milestones and
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md) for the current state and next steps.

## MCP server

`librepcb-mcp` lets an AI agent design a board through the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io): search parts in
the LibrePCB libraries, draw the schematic, place and route the board, run
ERC/DRC and export manufacturing data. The projects open in upstream
LibrePCB.

```sh
cargo install --path crates/librepcb-mcp
claude mcp add librepcb -- librepcb-mcp --workspace ~/LibrePCB-Workspace
```

Then ask for a design, e.g. "design a two-transistor LED blinker powered
from a 2-pin header, route it and export Gerbers". Libraries are installed
with the `library_install` tool (or copied to
`<workspace>/data/libraries/local/`). Autorouting uses
[Freerouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting) when a
`freerouting` launcher or `LIBREPCB_FREEROUTING_JAR` (Java 25) is
available, else the built-in router. See `crates/librepcb-mcp/src/lib.rs`
and [docs/mcp-design.md](docs/mcp-design.md).

## Building and testing

You need a recent stable Rust toolchain (edition 2024).

Many tests use upstream LibrePCB's test data, and some compare against the
upstream command line tool. `scripts/cloud-setup.sh` sets both up on a fresh
machine (Debian/Ubuntu packages, Rust if missing, the pinned upstream checkout
next to this repository, and the official `librepcb-cli` release run through
Xvfb):

```sh
scripts/cloud-setup.sh
```

Or check out upstream manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB.git ../LibrePCB
git -C ../LibrePCB submodule update --init tests/data share/librepcb/fontobene i18n libs/fontobene-qt
```

The location is set by `LIBREPCB_UPSTREAM_DIR` in `.cargo/config.toml`
(default `../LibrePCB`) and can be overridden from the environment:

```sh
LIBREPCB_UPSTREAM_DIR=/path/to/LibrePCB cargo test
```

Then:

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The file format migration test compares against the upstream command line
tool (same file format version), taken from `LIBREPCB_CLI` or `librepcb-cli`
on the `PATH`; without it, that comparison is skipped.

To see the canvas demo:

```sh
cargo run --release -p librepcb-canvas --features slint --example canvas_demo
```
